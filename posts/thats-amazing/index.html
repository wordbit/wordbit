          <p>I didn&rsquo;t end up going to the K63 building yesterday because Sora sprained her ankle, poor girl, she&rsquo;s so frail. It&rsquo;s funny, she learns a lot of her English phrases from &ldquo;The Truman Show&rdquo;, her favourite movie. She was horrified when I had a good laugh and told her Jim Carey&rsquo;s English was hardly standard. Especially phrases like &ldquo;Alrighty then, that&rsquo;s the whole kit and caboodle!&rdquo; But then I got to thinking, what is standard English? American English? British English? We all use the language in such idiosyncratic ways anyway.<br />
    So I headed into Seoul, poked around the Itaewon market, in the foreign district, where once again I couldn&rsquo;t help wandering where all the &lsquo;homeys&rsquo; come from. Why is there a thriving African American community in Seoul? What do they do? Maybe they&rsquo;re all soldiers, the &ldquo;combined forces&rdquo; army base is just around the corner. Speaking of which, I headed down to the base and checked to see if any of the Korean soldiers could speak English. They couldn&rsquo;t of course, which begs the question: How does a &ldquo;combined forces&rdquo; unit co-operate effectively without a common language? I have a feeling &ldquo;combined forces&rdquo; is just a euphemism for &ldquo;covert U.S. occupation&rdquo;. Anyways, I checked out the War memorial on the base, where they have disbanded tanks and planes on display as well as a museum showcase, where you can experience an authentic Vietnam in the &ldquo;combat chamber&rdquo; and pretend you&rsquo;re shooting Japanese soldiers in the virtual reality lounge&hellip; South Korea certainly has been in a lot of wars. Right from the Paleolithic onward, it&rsquo;s amazing they&rsquo;re still around.
    Tomorrow is the field trip - we&rsquo;re taking the little monsters (an endearing term, I assure you) to a movie. Should be good for them, although I don&rsquo;t think Arnold can hold it in for two hours&hellip;With him it&rsquo;s always &ldquo;Can I go bathroom!? Please Antoine-teacher! Hurry up!&rdquo; every five minutes. You remember little monkey Arnold? His dad is the Korean Mr. Bean?</p>
