<p>My wife really wanted this <a href="http://philandteds.com/productsus/pushus/explorerus#_overview">Phil and Ted&rsquo;s Explorer stroller</a>. We checked out Babies R Us, but as expected, the customer service was poor. No disrespect to all those hard-working retail people - I was one of them once - but this lady did not know anything about the product. They were charging about $540 for it. Yeah, I know, you could buy a second-hand car for that price. But, apparently, and I say apparently because the amount of research I&rsquo;ve done palls in comparison with my wife&rsquo;s diligent on-line sleuthing, this stroller is a sound investment. It will accommodate a baby all the way from newborn to about five years. You can also attach a car seat to it, or add an attachment to carry two kids.</p>

<p>Anyway, we ended up ordering this puppy from Amazon.com for $479 and they threw in the Doubles Kit for free (usually retails for $90). We also ordered an outdoor patio table and shipped them both to Point Roberts in the States for pick-up at TSB shipping. I&rsquo;m hoping the duty won&rsquo;t be too steep or maybe that wasn&rsquo;t such a good deal after all. We&rsquo;ll see. At least baby will have his/her pimped-out ride when he/she arrives.</p>
