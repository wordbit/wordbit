<p>I&rsquo;m a little late to the party, but I finished reading this Swedish crime thriller last night. It&rsquo;s been on the best seller lists for a while and thought I would give it a go. The story centres on a downtrodden journalist, Mikael Blomkvist as he investigates the mysterious disappearance of a girl who went missing 40 years earlier. He gets some help from the gothic, autistic, troubled, grown up Pippi Longstocking character, Lisbeth Salander. She&rsquo;s the one with the dragon tattoo by the way. The title doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do with the story.</p>

<p>In fact, the original Swedish title is <em>Men Who Hate Women</em>, which is a far more accurate description of a story populated with sadists, rapists, serial killers, and a combination of those. But that all comes later. Most of the first three quarters of the book is filled with a languorous stroll through textual analysis of old documents, family trees, aging photographs, and red herring interviews punctuated by the anarchy and violence of Lisbeth&rsquo;s story. There&rsquo;s also a vendetta against a banker mafia thrown in there.</p>

<p>This translation is crisp and uses sparse, yet vivid English. There is no miring in waffling prose here - the author cuts straight to it but still gives us plenty of atmosphere and tension. The balance between character development and action was perfect for me, but I could see some action-junkie readers starting to drift off if they expect a car chase or shootout on every page (there is only one of each of these in the whole book). Overall, this was a great read and I&rsquo;m looking forward to the next two books, which are part of the <em>Millennium Trilogy</em>.</p>
