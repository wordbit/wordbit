          <p>A lot of people were excited about the new iPads coming this month. As usual, the wild rumours had some people pumped. But what we got didn&rsquo;t quite live up to the hype. In fact, it set a new low bar. Let&rsquo;s dive into it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been twelve years since Steve Jobs first introduced the iPad. It was a dream come true at the time. Before 2010, touch-screen tablets only existed in <a href="https://youtu.be/yVqHoGKQXLI">Star Trek</a>.</p>

<p>Everybody wanted one. Initial sales were so high, many thought the laptop&rsquo;s days were numbered and a new age of touch-screen computing had begun. Over the next three years, the iPad got thinner, lighter, and even more powerful, culminating in the first iPad Air  in 2013 - a beautiful, sleek tablet that was so good, I could resist no longer and picked one up for myself.</p>

<p>Ten years on, and I still use that iPad Air every day. Even though it is an adequate YouTube machine, it is frustratingly slow and outdated. So, I decided that this will be the year that I upgrade. The fact that I&rsquo;ve been happy with the first-gen iPad Air for this long is a testament to how good it is. But it is also an indication that iPads never quite took off as computers. And by &ldquo;computers&rdquo;, I mean productivity machines that you do &ldquo;work&rdquo; on.</p>

<p>This tension is a common theme among tech enthusiasts, and if you&rsquo;re one of those, you&rsquo;ve no doubt come across this question before: Why is the iPad&rsquo;s software holding back such powerful hardware?</p>

<p>Well, I&rsquo;m not really interested in answering that question.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve long come to accept what the iPad is. It&rsquo;s fun and casual. You relax in bed with it. Like a phone, it&rsquo;s easy to pick up and instantly look something up. But unlike a phone, the big screen let&rsquo;s you spend a few minutes on a noncommittal mobile game without squinting. It&rsquo;s great for family FaceTime calls. It&rsquo;s perfect for watching short videos.</p>

<p>The iPad has never had multi-user accounts. It&rsquo;s a personal, intimate device and without the  burdensome association of &ldquo;work&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s a device you can simply enjoy using in your free time. I think that last point is an important one - nobody thinks of their work laptops fondly, but people love their iPads.</p>

<p>The problem is that Americans are obsessed with productivity. And all those hardcore geeks who work on computers everyday look at the iPad with a jealous gaze. They don&rsquo;t want the fun and carefree iPad - they want a workhorse. They have cried, and cried, and cried to Apple - a loud minority asking for better multi-tasking, better file management, an iPad that runs macOS and desktop-class apps, and so on.</p>

<p>So, in 2015, Apple tried to appease them with the iPad Pro. It didn&rsquo;t work.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t that Apple couldn&rsquo;t slap macOS on an iPad, because of course they could - easily. It&rsquo;s that Apple is a very different company than say, Microsoft, who were more than willing to put Windows on a tablet, despite the UI being all wrong for touch input.</p>

<p>The fundamental reason it didn&rsquo;t work is that Steve&rsquo;s core values on Apple &ldquo;being at the intersection of technology and liberal arts&rdquo; is deeply embedded into Apple&rsquo;s design philosophy. So, while the iPad Pro came with a nicer screen and better cameras, it also came with the Apple Pencil. It became clear then that the &ldquo;Pro&rdquo; in iPad Pro referred to professional artists and illustrators - not coders and mid-level managers. Those guys have always had the Mac - why should they have the iPad as well?</p>

<p>Anyway, to make a long story short (or is it too late to keep it short?), that&rsquo;s why I think the question over whether the iPad&rsquo;s software is holding back the hardware is a moot point. Apple should focus on keeping creatives happy and give up on trying to make the iPad appealing to power users. They just make a mess of it anyway because, as I said, they&rsquo;re not that kind of company. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/25/stage-manager-criticized-as-ipados-16-released/">poorly-received Stage Manager</a> is a prime example of this.</p>

<p>Continuing on with the story of the iPad Pro: In 2018, Apple re-designed the Pro with the now-familiar squared-off chassis and slimmer bezels with no home button and USB-C. It was - and still is - expensive, but represented the bleeding edge. Since then, the same design has trickled down to the iPad Air (and now the new 10th-gen iPad).</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2022. Apple&rsquo;s usual pattern has been to introduce a major re-design every four years. So, many were expecting something new and exciting for the iPad Pro at the October &ldquo;event&rdquo;. But, it didn&rsquo;t happen. The only new additions were an upgrade to the M2 chip and a new &ldquo;hover effect&rdquo; for the Apple Pencil.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/10/the_2022_ipad#fn1-2022-10-26">a footnote in his review</a>, Gruber speculates that the unchanged design &ldquo;might be a downwind effect of COVID â€” work from home, greatly reduced travel between California and China, and the global supply chain congestion&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s a sound conjecture, especially considering that the product roadmap is usually determined two or three years in advance. As much as we want to move on from COVID, we&rsquo;re only now feeling the full effect of the pandemic on Apple&rsquo;s hardware development and production.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the 10th-gen iPad got that nice redesign, which brings a modern look. But it has other compromises that left many iPad enthusiasts confused or even downright rankled.</p>

<p>A slightly worse display and chip compared to the iPad Air seems about right, given it&rsquo;s supposed to be the &ldquo;base&rdquo; iPad. But what everybody is crying about is that the 10th-gen iPad only supports the first-gen Apple Pencil, and then only with a hideous lightening-to-USB-C dongle.</p>

<p>But to me, this makes sense. Apple wants to push professional artists who use the Apple Pencil daily to the Pro line. What they thought was more important to base-model customers (primarily students, I&rsquo;d guess) was a nicer FaceTime experience. So, they re-positioned the selfie camera to a landscape orientation instead of using that space for the magnetic charging that the Apple Pencil 2 requires. They couldn&rsquo;t do both without some serious re-engineering.</p>

<p>That choice will be debated for a while to come, but, as someone who doesn&rsquo;t care that much about the Apple Pencil, I&rsquo;m okay with it. What bothers me far more is the price increase. In Canada, the base iPad now costs a hefty $600 (up from $429). Wow.</p>

<p>Maybe in two years, this iPad will be priced more appropriately, but right now&hellip; it isn&rsquo;t. But is the iPad Air worth $200 more? Hmmm, it&rsquo;s time to upgrade my iPad and I&rsquo;ve got a decision to make. Stay tuned for Part 2 of this tale to find out what it is (coming next month as usual).</p>

<p>In the meantime, I&rsquo;ve been enjoying another Apple accessory that I&rsquo;ve recently added to the ecosystem. I had an unused Best Buy gift card lying around, so I figured what the hell, and picked up the second-gen AirPods Pro that everybody is raving about. I got a free six-month Apple Music trial with it, so I cancelled my YouTube Music subscription (which I wasn&rsquo;t in love with). In the end, I&rsquo;m actually coming out ahead.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to pretend I can properly review these. For a detailed video review, my man <a href="https://youtu.be/q7DhG4pHwho">Kenneth</a> is underrated and deserves more views.</p>

<p>The short version is that, for such small buds, they sound really good and the ANC is incredible. The new H2 chip is doing a lot of heavy lifting using algorithms to make these sound like a choir of angels and to eliminate the sound of my microwave.</p>

<p>I am disappointed with the device switching though. Switching audio between my iPhone and Apple Watch just doesn&rsquo;t work. The audio slows down like an unplugged record player before stopping completely. I&rsquo;ve tried a few things, but haven&rsquo;t figured out how to fix it yet. Fortunately, I can still control iPhone audio with my Apple Watch, but the whole audio-switching experience is hardly as seamless as I was expecting. First World problem, I know.</p>

<p>In general, the second-gen AirPods Pro just ooze high quality all round, and they&rsquo;re undoubtedly the nicest earbuds I&rsquo;ve ever owned. I wouldn&rsquo;t pay full price for them though - there is a lot of healthy competition in the earbud space these days and you can get 80% of the same audio experience a lot cheaper elsewhere.</p>

<p>Apple Music is polished and I actually like the emphasis on human curation rather than relying solely on algorithms. Spatial audio (Dolby Atmos) may not blow away non-audiophiles, but is icing on the cake for new releases that are properly mixed with surround sound in mind. I&rsquo;ll see how the next six months goes before deciding which music subscription to stick with, but I like what I&rsquo;m hearing so far.</p>

<p>Speaking of subscriptions, for many years Amazon has begged me to sign up with Amazon Prime and I&rsquo;ve always refused. You have to admire their persistence though because they finally offered me something I couldn&rsquo;t refuse:  A <em>Lord of the Rings</em> show.</p>

<p>The most expensive TV show ever made, <em>The Rings of Power</em> is fantastic. It looks stunning in 4K Dolby Vision. Production values match and exceed the Peter Jackson movies. I can&rsquo;t say the writing is as good, but it&rsquo;s impossible to write at Tolkien&rsquo;s level, so they were doomed to fail on that front from the start. I can forgive the mediocre writing though because it&rsquo;s just so great to be in Middle Earth again.</p>

<p>As a rule of thumb, I don&rsquo;t spend more than $20 a month on TV subscriptions, so I&rsquo;ve started doing the juggling act of subscribing and unsubscribing to bounce between services. I&rsquo;ve just finished up my one-year free trial of Disney Plus. I had a delightful year catching up on all the Star Wars and Marvel shows, but everything good must come to an end.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also burned through the must-watch shows in my Netflix queue, but I&rsquo;m done for a while. Netflix charges over 20 bucks a month for 4K, which is too much to set and forget. Their new plan with ads is cheap enough to keep as a holding pattern so the kids can still watch their shows (no ads on kids profiles fortunately).</p>

<p>There are a few really good shows on Amazon Prime Video now, so I&rsquo;ll sub for a while after <em>The Rings of Power</em> until switching again, but I&rsquo;m not making the mistake of trapping myself in the ecosystem - that&rsquo;s how they get you.</p>
