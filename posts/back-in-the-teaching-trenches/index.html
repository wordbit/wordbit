          <p>Yep, war metaphors are always appropriate in &lsquo;teacher discourse&rsquo;. Well, being back at work isn&rsquo;t that bad. I&rsquo;m beginning to find that a little caffeine continuously flowing through ones veins allows one to keep up with even the most frenetic kids. Of course I officially have no life, so being a slave to one&rsquo;s current occupation doesn&rsquo;t seem a great sacrifice at this point. Well, let no-one accuse me of being a pessimist, that&rsquo;s what I say.</p>

<p>Although my &lsquo;official&rsquo; Korean name is &ldquo;Lee Ki-Chan&rdquo;, some of my more enterprising students have named me &ldquo;Ghemihanmarie&rdquo;, which translates as &lsquo;a single ant&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s literal translation being &ldquo;ant one&rdquo;, a play on the phonetics of &ldquo;Antoine&rdquo;. And on the subject of amusing naming anecdotes, one of my new adult students wants his English name to be &ldquo;Car&rdquo;, because he likes driving fast cars! I had a &ldquo;Swan&rdquo; in my class once, that&rsquo;s a cool English name, but &ldquo;Car&rdquo;, mmmmm&hellip;.I mean the guy is 45 years old, do I detect a mid-life crisis? Or am I just being a cynical bastard, even though I say these things in jest?</p>

<p>Perhaps you have seen this on the news recently. The president of the Hyundai corporation committed suicide after being embroiled in a political scandal. What happened was, he paid the North Korean government a few million dollars to sign a peace treaty a while back. After this was revealed to the public, his honour was severely compromised and his only recourse was to end his life. It&rsquo;s alarming to think that the negotiations between the North and South are underscored by corruption and bribery. Peace seems so tentative right now, especially with the U.S. adamant that they &ldquo;will no longer ignore the North Korean threat&rdquo;. I must say that anti-american sentiment in Korea is particularly high right now, a lot of the time for the wrong reasons unfortunately (too complicated to explain here). I&rsquo;ve witnessed some large demonstrations in Seoul with rank upon rank of armed riot police poised tensely on the sidelines. Anyways, that&rsquo;s, er&hellip;it. I&rsquo;ve just run out of steam.</p>
