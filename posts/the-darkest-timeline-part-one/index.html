          <p>I&rsquo;ve been looking back at the past year and chastising myself for only writing half as many posts as I&rsquo;d hoped.</p>

<p>So, I&rsquo;m going to mix it up a bit and write more fiction on this blog. I&rsquo;ll start with a serialized short story with the modest goal of one &ldquo;chapter&rdquo; per post with no set schedule and see how it goes.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll intersperse these fictional interludes with other posts as well, so I&rsquo;m not going all-in on the fiction thing.</p>

<p>I should warn prospective readers that any fiction on this site is probably rated R so you can expect some coarse language at the very least. Also, this is all very rough and experimental and unedited, so don&rsquo;t take this as a finished piece of work - it&rsquo;s just for fun. For fun, but not a necessarily a &ldquo;fun&rdquo; writing style because my writing tends to get really dark really quickly. I should probably work on that.</p>

<p>As you may know, I have a thing for time travel. So, the first story I&rsquo;m starting with could be considered <em>Back to the Future</em> fan fiction of sorts. None of the characters from this movie appear here, but I&rsquo;ve shamefully ripped off the plot from <em>Back to the Future 2</em>.</p>

<p>The genesis for this story lies in this <a href="https://youtu.be/g5xs4vMx-fM">YouTube</a> video where Biff Tannen is replaced with Donald Trump with such eerie seamlessness. I&rsquo;ve since learned, by the way, that the <em>Back to the Future 2</em> writers intentionally based Biff&rsquo;s character on Trump.</p>

<p>Obviously, the <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-darkest-timeline">darkest timeline meme</a> has also contributed to the thought process behind this story. And a weird dream, which I won&rsquo;t go into.</p>

<p>In the <em>Back to the Future</em> films, Marty McFly jumps back in time 30 years from 1985 to 1955 and also 30 years forward in time from 1985 to 2015. I thought it would be fun for a protagonist in 2015 to jump back in time to 1985 to experience all the amusingly anachronistic quirks of another era. It&rsquo;s funny, and more than a little disturbing, to think of the 80s as another era because I lived through that time.</p>

<p>Anyway, this preamble is now longer than part one of my story, so I&rsquo;d best begin.</p>

<p></p>

<hr />

<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about Judas lately.</p>

<p>Judas has been reviled throughout history as the betrayer of Jesus Christ, the Messiah. But in the <em>Gospel of Judas</em> - a heretical Gnostic manuscript long-since buried by the Catholic Church - Judas is portrayed, not as a greedy opportunist, but as Christ’s favourite apostle.</p>

<p>In this alternate version of history, Judas was obeying a divine ordinance to hand Jesus over to the authorities. Through secret conversations with Judas, Jesus shaped him to be an instrument with a divine purpose.</p>

<p>This is the Judas paradox: Without Judas, Christ could not fulfill his destiny - to die and atone for the sins of humanity. Without Judas, Jesus could not become a martyr - he could not save us from iniquity and eternal damnation. Without Judas, paradise would remain empty for all time.</p>

<p>But the Coptic language of this gospel is hard to translate, and Biblical scholars are not in agreement. An alternative translation of this text sees Judas, not as a mortal instrument, but as a demon - sent by Lucifer to slay humanity’s only hope of salvation.</p>

<p>Which history is the right one? This is a question I have struggled with. Not struggled with in the academic sense; my struggle is intimate and tortured and very real. Because although history can be interpreted in many different ways, it has always remained immutable. Until now.</p>

<p>I also have a betrayer - a Judas whom I love so fiercely that the betrayal stings to the core of my soul. In the duelling tug between love and disappointment that waxes in deceit&rsquo;s aftermath, it&rsquo;s impossible to see the motivations of my Judas. Suffice to say, God has never spoken to me about my divine purpose. I certainly never asked for the betrayal.</p>

<p>But, whatever the motivation, a knife in the back has forced me to choose, as Jesus once chose. Do I choose to die, or do I choose to live?</p>

<p>Self-sacrifice is not easy, but I imagine it&rsquo;s easier for a soldier in the heat of battle. When that soldier dives onto a grenade to save his squad, he is reacting in a split second, adrenaline surging through his veins. But I have time to think about this. Lots of time.</p>

<p>And I never wanted to be a fucking messiah.</p>

<p>But if I choose life over death, I am not letting down a few of my closest friends. I am condemning the entire human race to hell.</p>

<p>No pressure, right.</p>

<p>When the moment comes, will I be able to do it? Will I be able to change history and usher humanity into paradise - a paradise that has no place for me?</p>

<p>The truth is, I don’t know. I’m not a demi-god with supernatural powers. I’m just a smart-ass kid faced with an agonizing choice. Or maybe I&rsquo;m just a lamb being carried to the slaughter&hellip;</p>

<p>I apologize.</p>

<p>These are heavy, heavy thoughts and I’m burdening you with too many meaningless rhetorical questions. Let me start at the beginning.</p>
