          <p>The recent iPhone event was a triumph for apple&rsquo;s marketing division. By putting last year&rsquo;s model in a new plastic housing and adding a splash of colour, what is old is new again (iPhone 5C). And a tip of the hat can go to the engineering team for beefing up security with the fingerprint sensor (iPhone 5S). But at this year&rsquo;s apple party, there was a once venerated apple device that was notably absent - the iPod. I can honestly say, that this is the one apple product I use the most:</p>

<p><img src="/images/shuffle-blue-300x199.jpg" alt="shuffle-blue" /></p>

<p>The second-generation iPod shuffle, with a design so perfect that when apple tried - and failed - to go with a new design in the third gen, they wisely returned to the second-gen design in later models. And guess what? It&rsquo;s a wearable device;  That belt clip was a deft design decision - a laser-focused usability improvement targeted at the fitness crowd. Now when I hear rumours of an apple iWatch, I hope that maybe the shuffle will evolve after all.</p>

<p>But I also worry, is apple trying to please everybody? Is the iWatch going to be a fashion accessory with a fancy curved display that can proudly be brandished in a night club, as well as worn on a run? Because I can&rsquo;t imagine sweating with something like that strapped to my wrist. The iWatch, proudly worn on the wrist as a testimony to apple&rsquo;s brand, may shame the humble shuffle that sits hidden at the waist on somebody&rsquo;s track pants.</p>

<p>Perhaps the shuffle is dead after all and that saddens me. But, then again this is all speculation. Will apple amaze us once again? I just don&rsquo;t know. It hasn&rsquo;t happened since Steve left us almost two years ago to this day.</p>

<p>An excellent article on the original iPhone published by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/06/magazine/and-then-steve-said-let-there-be-an-iphone.html">the New York Times</a> today really hit home - Steve Jobs was apple. The staggering amount of sheer will and engineering chops required to build a revolutionary new product from scratch just blows my mind. And Steve moved mountains to get it done. Looking back on the last two years at apple since his death, it&rsquo;s hard to have faith that a technological breakthrough of this magnitude could ever happen again without him. But life goes on. And I&rsquo;ll continue to run with my shuffle - a perfect device that may never evolve. And that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
