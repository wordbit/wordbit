          <p>Much-loved Vancouver writer Derek Miller passed away yesterday at the age of 41. He had struggled with cancer for the past few years. I interviewed Derek for a Print Futures assignment a while back and wrote <a href="http://wordbitarchives.files.wordpress.com/2007/02/dmprofile.pdf">an article</a> about his writing career. In the interview, Derek told me that he didn&rsquo;t know what the future would hold, but he knew for sure he would still be writing. He was right.</p>

<p>He surely couldn&rsquo;t predict he would die a few years later, but he did write until the very end. <a href="http://www.penmachine.com/2011/05/the-last-post">His final blog post</a> is his own obituary - a true writer wouldn&rsquo;t have it any other way. Indeed, through his blog he has chronicled his own painful journey as his health steadily declined to a point where he couldn&rsquo;t leave the house - and barely leave his bed. But he still wrote.</p>

<p>I am greatly saddened by Derek&rsquo;s death. He inspired me to stay on the path to becoming a writer. He has inspired so many with his willingness to help others and with his words. Derek wrote with a sincerity that is rare in a world full of people who are scared of writing the truth. Me included. So here&rsquo;s to you Derek - your voice is now silent but you will never be forgotten.</p>
