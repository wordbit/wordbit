          <p>Well, today was my dreaded open class, without a doubt the most nerve-racking thing we&rsquo;ve ever had to do at the school. I must say though, if they&rsquo;d sprung it on me a few months back I would have crumpled under the pressure but these days I&rsquo;m a real trooper. This time there was a full compliment of mothers eager to see their well-trained darlings perform for them. There were no major transgressions of our rules, nobody spoke Korean, nobody tried to steal my flashcards or use me as a human punching bag or set anything on fire. So, by my desperate standards they were positively angelic. I was more worried that the mothers would see that I wasn&rsquo;t exactly a crackerjack teacher. I fully acknowledge that I&rsquo;m not the world&rsquo;s greatest kindergarten teacher, but I have learnt a few tricks of the trade. Anyways, the feedback I got was that the mothers were &lsquo;satisfied with my teaching&rsquo;, so I guess I did ok.</p>

<p>Actually, the Kitten class have gotten a lot better, with a little patience and persistence even the nastiest little junior warmonger can be trained to become a respectable member of kindergarten society. In the beginning I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be able to teach these kids anything. When they were raw recruits nine months ago, they couldn&rsquo;t even pronounce their English names. Now we&rsquo;re starting to communicate with each other and have conversations, and they can express their needs to me in English. Before when they were yelling and crying at me in Korean I felt quite helpless. Yes, it&rsquo;s really gratifying and I feel a real sense of accomplishment in that respect.</p>

<p>On a side note, the <em>ajummas</em> working in the produce section at my local supermarket have started giving me major discounts on my fruit for some reason. I guess it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m such a loyal customer, what fantastic service! They&rsquo;d never do that at <em>Safeway</em>.</p>
