<p>I recently finished watching the complete <em>Firefly</em> series on Netflix. That sounds like a lot of TV watching, but it only ran for 14 episodes before it got cancelled due to low ratings. Most geeks agree, however, that this show was a little gem, was poorly marketed by Fox, and should never have died so early. After watching it, I would have to agree.</p>

<p>I guess this show falls into the space-western genre, and with plenty of horses, bandits, prostitutes, and bounty hunters, I&rsquo;d say it falls more into the &ldquo;western&rdquo; part of the spectrum. The CGI is a bit dated, but not bad for 2002. What really drives the show are the terrific characters, with particularly strong female leads, and wonderful camaraderie among the crew.</p>

<p>With a liberal sprinkling of romance thrown in, I can see why both genders enjoy this show immensely. The creator, Joss Whedon, played with several sub genres throughout the too-short series, with suspense, horror, adventure, and comedy providing a different mood for any given episode.</p>

<p>On the negative side, I&rsquo;d have to say that the acting and the overall story arc is not as good as the crazy-good Battlestar Gallactica - but it would be hard for any Sci-Fi to come close. Given a chance, this show could have blossomed in its maturity. Too bad it was axed in its infancy. I will definitely be watching the follow-up movie, <em>Serenity</em>, which the fans basically demanded into being. A lot of questions were left unanswered, so I&rsquo;m looking forward to some closure. Recently there was some talk of resurrecting the show independently and putting it out on the internet. Probably not going to happen, but there&rsquo;s always hope.</p>
