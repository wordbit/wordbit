<p>In this rocky economic climate, marketing yourself has never been more crucial if you want to survive the inevitable cutbacks. When it comes to technical writing, it&rsquo;s a useful exercise to understand and appreciate what companies look for in a writer.</p>

<p>Lyndsey Amott, in an <a href="http://www.docsymmetry.com/hiring-a-technical-writer.html">article on her website</a>, stresses that industry knowledge should not be a primary deciding factor when mulling over suitable candidates. Her top three must-haves are:</p>

<pre><code>1. design a document that looks good both on paper and on-line  
2. design a document that can be updated easily  
3. write instructions that are easy to understand
</code></pre>

<p>She goes on to say that the proof of a good writer lies in the way they organize their thoughts and that inexperienced writers shouldn&rsquo;t necessarily be dismissed.</p>

<p>Technical writing consultant Jean Weber makes some good points in <a href="http://www.jeanweber.com/newsite/?page_id=21">this article</a>. She agrees that the writing is more important than the software or technical expertise. She advises companies to look for problem-solvers who keep digging until they find all the answers. But they should be somebody tactful, not abrasive.</p>

<p>Employers are always concerned with costs and staying on budget. If you can relay the value of creating relevant content in a specific context and to a specific audience, you&rsquo;re on the right track. Remember that as a technical writer you&rsquo;re the bridge between subject matter experts and the stakeholders, the marketers, and the end-users. Without you, knowledge could not be channeled into capital gain.</p>

<p>So, if you find your head on the chopping block, start thinking like your employer and ask yourself why they should keep you around. The answer could just save your neck.</p>
