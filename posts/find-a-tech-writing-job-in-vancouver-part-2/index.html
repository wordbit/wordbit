<p>I mentioned in part one of this series that 80% of jobs can only be found in that elusive place called &ldquo;the hidden job market.&rdquo; About 20% of those gigs can be gotten through employment services, cold calling, and other tactics, such as information interviews. But the other 60% are landed through referrals. That makes networking your only way to access a big chunk of the job market.</p>

<p>So how do you rustle up some contacts in Vancouver, a city that has a reputation for being a tad on the chilly side?</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Well, a great way to get started is to join the local <a href="http://www.stcwestcoast.ca/">West coast STC</a> chapter. Volunteering for them is a great way to make some contacts, probably even more so that just showing up for meetings.</p>

<p>Sign up for <a href="http://www.bctechnology.com/">T-Net direct</a>, a weekly newsletter that tells you what BC technology events are happening around town. Go to events outside of your field, where you don&rsquo;t expect to see a lot of other writers. That way you&rsquo;ll be more unique and make more valuable connections than you would hanging out with other writers who are looking for work.</p>

<p>Let everyone know you&rsquo;re looking for work, and if your cousin&rsquo;s roommate&rsquo;s girlfriend tells you her brother is a technical writer, ask for his contact info and set up an informational interview. Having some connection, no matter how distant, is always better than interviewing a complete stranger.</p>

<p>Most importantly, don&rsquo;t network to find work. Network to be social and meet people. If you approach everybody as a possible job lead, they&rsquo;ll smell the sleaze on you a mile away. Stay loose and have fun.</p>

<p>So how do you ace the tech-writing interview? That&rsquo;ll be in part 3, coming this Friday.</p>
