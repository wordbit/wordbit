          <p>On board the train to Victoria Falls…</p>

<p>Waiting for the train to leave… and hoping I get a whole booth to myself…</p>

<p>Walked all the way from the hostel, what a bitch.</p>

<p>Let me backtrack a bit: (by the way, seriously doubt this thing is going to leave on time)</p>

<p>Got to Bulawayo last night just in time to make dinner. Unfortunately, there’s this English guy living in the dorm and I’m not kidding - he is such a prick, he literally makes my hair stand on end. I’ll probably have to deal with him again when I get back from the falls.</p>

<p>I read <em>Hideous Kinky</em> today - took about four hours. I don’t think I’ve ever just picked up a book and read it from cover to cover - it’s like watching a movie.</p>

<p>Well, the train is supposed to leave now, I knew it wouldn’t. Flashbacks to our train trips in Europe, oh my god - nothing could top those - we were even sleeping on the floor in a Spanish train once.</p>

<p>I got a 2nd-class ticket - just been kicked out of my cabin, now crammed in a small one with five other guys. Shit.</p>
