<p>It&rsquo;s Victoria day today, in Canada that is, and I&rsquo;m not at all sure why it&rsquo;s celebrated, I&rsquo;m assuming it&rsquo;s Queen Victoria&rsquo;s birthday, but I could be wrong. Actually, I&rsquo;m in a gloriously good mood, but alas, the poem I&rsquo;m including today is quite incongruent with my current mellow vibe. I am running out of poems, you see. I certainly don&rsquo;t have any happy ones left.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t wish to strike a dark note; in general life is great. I recently finished writing another song, which my brother produced. I&rsquo;ve been busy with work, for good and ill. I was on the 8:00 pm news in Korea (KBS) for a documentary they did on Korean children studying in Canada. When I found out the story had a slightly negative slant, I was glad I did not widely publicize this event. Even so, it was cool to be on the telly (albeit for a total of 5 seconds max). Yesterday Angela and I went on a grueling, yet enchanting, hike up Mount Townsend in the Olympic mountain range. I started having my accustomary visions, the ones that happen when I&rsquo;m sick and dehydrated. The thought that lingers even now is: Why is Chlorophyll green and not red? If grass, vegetation and trees were bright red in colour instead of green, would red be considered a colour soothing to the eyes?</p>

<p>Here is my dark poem for the day:</p>

<h2 id="the-liminal-powder-room">The Liminal powder room</h2>

<p>Sickly passage warp the ways</p>

<p>I can function, like being born into the care</p>

<p>Of deathâ€™s harbinger,</p>

<p>A far worse fate than meeting the master.</p>

<p>(by all accounts)</p>

<p>Finality is stretched into eternity</p>

<p>And I too am stretched too thin like opaque paint</p>

<p>On a mottled wall</p>

<p>Primed for failure, preened to faint</p>

<p>Like a flustered lady trussed up</p>

<p>In her corset, pink and ruddy</p>

<p>A neophyte reaper socialite</p>
