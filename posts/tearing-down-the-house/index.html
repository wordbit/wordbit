          <p>You have to destroy to re-build. So, once again, wordbit.com gets a makeover.</p>

<p>For a long time, wordbit.com pointed to <a href="http://wordbit.tumblr.com">my tumblr blog</a>. But, I&rsquo;ve since found that tumblr isn&rsquo;t for me. Total respect for the platform and the people on it, but I found that longish text entries were passed over in favour of animated gifs and youtube videos. I do love these things, but I&rsquo;m also a writer, and need a place to express myself outside of any constraint or cultural influence. In short, I found myself longing for the freedom of Wordpress. So, I&rsquo;ve decided to come home.</p>

<p>But, it wasn&rsquo;t enough to return to <a href="http://www.wordbit.freehostia.com">the old ways</a>. The aesthetic that appeals to me now is clean and uncluttered. I&rsquo;m putting the focus squarely on the words, the typography, the text. So, I&rsquo;ve stripped away anything superfluous. Say goodbye to comments, categories, tags, blogrolls, about me pages, and meta this and that and so on. And what a relief to just write without worrying about these trappings. Because that&rsquo;s what they are - just distractions that take you away from the communication experience. Mmmmm&hellip;. I like that. Communication experience - the unfiltered thought transference between writer and reader - that somewhat sacred exchange only fully realized today in good old-fashioned paper novels.</p>

<p>So, here we are - kicking it old school, like a stripped-down <a href="http://sunsangnim.livejournal.com/">livejournal</a>. Back to just good old writing - pouring it all out for whoever is interested. No Twitter. No Facebook. No social anything. Just you and me. I love it. And dear reader, I hope you do too.</p>
