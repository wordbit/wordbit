          <p>Good evening one and all. First of all, I can see! Although I think I&rsquo;ve merely become accustomed to sub-standard vision, that discomforting sensation of squinting through a fog has passed. I do tend to over-dramatize things, I know, but regardless I really was concerned. Tonight the other teachers were scuttling around in a working frenzy, and you should have seen the look of horror on their faces when I left &lsquo;early&rsquo;. It seems a travesty to leave before the whole group does, but it was nine o clock, I&rsquo;d just had the longest week of my life putting in these damn twelve hour days and I was finished. So I handed Debbie my report cards and monthly syllabuses and said &ldquo;Sianara baby&rdquo;. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going home!?&rdquo; she says incredulously. Next week I&rsquo;ll be putting in long nights doing phone teaching, so I think the disdain is unnecessary. I just have to laugh though at the Korean way of doing things. I don&rsquo;t think they could ever fully comprehend the phrase &ldquo;take it easy&rdquo;. Lexically, of course they could, but not the psychological mindset that accompanies said phrase.</p>

<p>Anyways, it sounds like I&rsquo;m complaining, but I&rsquo;m not. Internally I am delightfully amused by Korean idiosyncrasies and the most I&rsquo;ll ever do is shake my head and have a good laugh at it all. This is partly due to the fact that as a foreigner I am not a part of Korean society and am at liberty to exercise my own individuality without being ridiculed. In Korea, foreigners literally are &ldquo;non-persons&rdquo; that do not fit into the social hierarchy and there are no rules for interacting with foreigners, whereas there are rules for interacting with different genders, ages, occupations etc. as a member of Korean society. This gives one certain freedoms because you can justify your behaviour by pandering to the mystique and uncertainty surrounding foreigners. Of course this isn&rsquo;t justification for boorish behaviour but as in the above situation, I cannot be reprimanded because I am somewhat above working doctrines. I have to go, American Beauty is on TV!</p>
