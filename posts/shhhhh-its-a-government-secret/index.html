          <h5 id="date"> Tue Nov 21, 2006 </h5>
          <p>I recently received a letter from the provincial government telling me that I was disqualified from receiving a student loan. You can imagine the horror this letter inspired at this point in the semester. Anyway, sleepless nights aside, I called up the Student Loan centre today and I spoke to a robotic young lady called Angelina. She told me that I was in good standing and that I should call the CIBC student loan centre to see if the restriction originated from there. So, she gave me the number and I called up CIBC, and guess who took the call? <em>Angelina!</em> So, I asked if we had not been speaking a moment ago and she mumbled something noncommittal and proceeded to give me the same drill we had just gone through. You know the one: has your address changed recently, has your phone number changed, etc, etc. I felt like protesting that we already had gone through this rigmarole a few minutes ago, but she wasn&rsquo;t having it. So, Angelina told me that there are no problems at CIBC. So I said &ldquo;So, there are no restrictions on Canada Student loans and CIBC loans?&rdquo; Then she said &ldquo;CIBC is ok, but I don&rsquo;t know about Canada Student loans, you would have to call them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I just called them, <em>and I talked to you there!</em> Yes you! Angelina the robot girl. If the government student loan division and the CIBC student loan centre are the same entity, why do I have to waste money on postage stamps to two different addresses? Everyone knows government institutions don&rsquo;t communicate with each other, but did you know government employees are prohibited from communicating with themselves? What a schizophrenic bunch.</p>

<p>We were told that CIBC was taking over loans negotiated before 2000, but guess what people. It&rsquo;s the same damn bureaucratic department, they just don&rsquo;t want you to know about it. Think you&rsquo;re dealing with the bank?</p>

<p>Think again.</p>
