          <p>Well, back into work full swing, and I have extra classes this month because of the special Winter program. The thing is that there&rsquo;s only two boys in the program, which mean a staff allocation of three teachers for the two boys, adjusted schedules and me waking up an hour earlier every day&hellip; just for two lads. At least they&rsquo;re nice boys and they do their homework and everything, but still, it&rsquo;s a little ridiculous. We also had lots of new students in the other classes and nobody ever tells me I&rsquo;m getting new students so it&rsquo;s always a surprise. Consequently, I gave up trying to give them their English names with thought and consideration. &ldquo;OK, your name is&hellip;.er&hellip;.Matt&hellip;.no&hellip;.er, Dan, ok? Hi Dan!&rdquo; Or alternatively sticking my head into the teacher&rsquo;s room and yelling <em>&ldquo;Somebody give me an English name, quick!&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>And then next month comes graduation. I told my kindergarten kids that I must go home to Canada next month and they were quite sad about it. Poor things, I&rsquo;ll miss my kids. Well, I&rsquo;ll be passing the torch along to Dean, I managed to get him my job. I&rsquo;m helping out a fellow anthropologist and the recruiting bonus doesn&rsquo;t hurt either.</p>

<p>I must say though that the students were stubbornly lazy after their brief vacation. I couldn&rsquo;t even coerce them into colouring nicely on their first day back. They just scribbled over the picture with one colour and I started fuming because they weren&rsquo;t even <em>trying</em> to colour in the lines. I got a bit bored too and started teaching my Green class the story in English and Afrikaans - &ldquo;Jy kan nie kry my nie, ek is die gingerbroodman&rdquo; The translation is terrible I know. Anyhow, I soon gave that up because now they actually beg me to read the story in what they call &ldquo;ugly English&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see, what else? Not much to tell really, did I mention I finally got round to watching Lord of the Rings? I was getting annoyed though, firstly because the couple next to me kicked over my drink and I was thirsty the whole movie and didn&rsquo;t want to miss anything by buying a new one. And secondly, every time Legolas came on-screen all the Korean girls were gushing and swooning over him and making appreciative noises. It&rsquo;s the long blond hair and boyish face, I tell you, they just love blondies over here, and Legolas is as exotic as they come I guess. But, come on, he&rsquo;s an elf, not a sex symbol.</p>
