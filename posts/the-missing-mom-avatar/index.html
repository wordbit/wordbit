          <p>Why aren&rsquo;t there more mom avatars in video gaming? I&rsquo;m just throwing that out there. I haven&rsquo;t done much research on this topic, but I can speculate. As the protagonist in the game&rsquo;s narrative, the avatar has become more complex and interesting these days, which is great. And it seems that there are more options for female gamers, as far as customization goes. I&rsquo;m thinking of the FemShep in the <em>Mass Effect</em> trilogy, and so on. There&rsquo;s still plenty of objectification (maybe more-so in sub-cultures like the Japanese game industry), but overall strong female characters are out there (looking at you Lara Craft).</p>

<p>But when it comes to playing a parent - mom is out in the cold. The father-daughter type relationship has come up most recently in Naughty Dog&rsquo;sÂ <em>Last of Us</em> (which I haven&rsquo;t played) and also the excellent <em>Walking Dead</em> game by Telltale. The emotional bond fatherhood engenders is also explored in <em>Heavy Rain</em>. There are probably more examples out there. But I can&rsquo;t think of a single game out there where you are a mom (or mom-type character).</p>

<p>It could be the perceived demographic of gamers - although there are more female gamers than ever, most game developers probably can&rsquo;t envision moms doing any kind of gaming beyond pretend yoga on the <em>Wii Fit</em>. Or maybe it&rsquo;s the nature of games - where the story is almost always driven by a fight or flight situation where you have to gun down zombies / aliens / bad people (or run away from them). Are we uncomfortable thinking about a mom who is willing to kill?</p>

<p>But then again, what is more natural than a mom protecting her child? A mom backed into a corner would likely wield that shotgun with far more determination than a trained but emotionally-detached soldier. Tough mom characters appear in the movies, why not in games? Think of how awesome Sigourney Weaver was in <em>Aliens</em>, when she faced down the xenomorph queen slobbering over the little girl and says &ldquo;Get away from her, you bitch&rdquo; with such quiet conviction that her words seem more powerful than the mechanized robot suit she&rsquo;s sitting in. Why can&rsquo;t I play her in a game?</p>
