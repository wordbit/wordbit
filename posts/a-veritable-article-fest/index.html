          <p>This year has been busy and exciting and just plain exhausting. But I&rsquo;ve finally found some time to upload a bunch of the articles that I&rsquo;ve had published this year for <em>alive</em> and <em>blush</em> magazines. The majority focus on green issues. I&rsquo;ve been somewhat typecast as the devil&rsquo;s green advocate, being asked to find flaws in all manner of righteous green concepts. To read one, click on the image.</p>

<p><a href="http://wordbit.freehostia.com/scans/blush2.html"><img src="http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/blush0002.jpg" alt="blush0002" /></a>Baby&rsquo;s nontoxic nursery: Preparing a healthy space for your newborn. What paints should you choose when decorating baby&rsquo;s new room? Surrounding your new child with noxious fumes is the last thing you want to do.</p>

<p><a href="http://wordbit.freehostia.com/scans/Sept09.html"><img src="http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/sep090001.jpg" alt="sep090001" /></a> Lawn warfare: Pesticide and herbicide use in Canada. I interviewed the PR person from the David Suzuki Foundation as well as a professor of biomolecular chemistry to write this one.</p>

<p><a href="http://wordbit.freehostia.com/scans/August09.html"><img src="http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/august090002.jpg" alt="august090002" /></a> Get in the habit: 10 easy ways to shrink your carbon footprint. This one is self explanatory. But did you know the concept for a carbon footprint was derived from those newfangled desktops in the early 90s that stood upright instead of lying flat?</p>

<p><a href="http://wordbit.freehostia.com/scans/July09.html"><img src="http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/july090005.jpg" alt="july090005" /></a> In it for the money: Green initiatives that are good for our <strike>ecology</strike> economy. This is one of those slightly cynical pieces. The intro comes from a really funny ad for IBM that you can <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSNFE6eUjfY">watch here on Youtube</a>. The art department did an awesome job with this one.</p>

<p><a href="http://wordbit.freehostia.com/scans/March09.html"><img src="http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/march090002.jpg" alt="march090002" /></a> The eco dilemma: Why electric cars won&rsquo;t save the world. Once again, an alternative look at a green <em>deus ex machina</em> (a term, incidentally, that I had originally used in the intro - but my editor wisely replaced this rather academic term with &ldquo;save the day&rdquo;).</p>

<p><a href="http://wordbit.freehostia.com/scans/April09.html"><img src="http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/April090001.jpg" alt="April090001" /></a> Selenium and cancer: Good news and bad. A short piece on the links between cancer and an antioxidant called selenium.</p>

<p><a href="http://wordbit.freehostia.com/scans/09shorts.html"><img src="http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/march090001.jpg" alt="march090001" /></a> Two very short pieces: Cleaning our lakes - about a government restriction of phosphates, and When TVs die - about the switchover from analog to digital and the potential aftermath of discarded TVs in our landfills.</p>
