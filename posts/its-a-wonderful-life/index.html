          <p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/antoinehenrigiraud/photo8.html">I&rsquo;ve updated my website! Click here to check out my latest photographs!  A little composition I&rsquo;ve entitled &ldquo;surreal&rdquo;</a></p>

<p>I was horrified on Thursday night as I watched Sora pack up all her belongings and clear out her desk and tearfully announce to me that she was quitting and wouldn&rsquo;t be coming in tomorrow. I don&rsquo;t need to go into all the details and all the hypocrisy, but she was the primary scapegoat in this whole &ldquo;bad pronunciation&rdquo; witch-hunt. Smooth move on the part of the &ldquo;management team&rdquo; (read: dictatorship, or even better: Debbietatorship), antagonizing someone to the point where they feel so bad and ashamed of themselves that they can&rsquo;t take it any more. Anyways, after a long talk with Won Jang Nim on Friday she tenuously decided to stick it out until graduation at least. Phew, <em>wiping the sweat off his brow</em> what a nightmare it would be if she quit. Won Jang Nim&rsquo;s plan to introduce a whole new crew next year is, in my opinion, franchise suicide but I won&rsquo;t be around to witness it, so&hellip; whatever.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Sora, Sulu, her sister and I went to VIPS in Ilsan&hellip;.again!&hellip;.and I attacked the Salad Bar buffet with a vengeance&hellip;again!&hellip;.but I only managed to shovel down four plates this time, even though I slowed down for desert. It was so bitterly cold last night it made Canada seem tropical. Maybe I should buy some thermal underwear or something. Afterwards I hung out with Sulu and her sister and chatted and watched a bit of telly which I haven&rsquo;t done in a while. Trista the bachelorette married Ryan on TV? Yikes! Michael Jackson and little boys? Yech! Now I remember why I avoid television like the plague. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonderful life&rdquo; came on and it reminded me of Millie Creighton making us watch it in our &ldquo;Anthropology of Religion&rdquo; class and how it&rsquo;s supposed to relate to the meaning of life, suffering, altruism in the community etc. etc. Now I&rsquo;m wondering just what fundamental principle she was trying to get at, I wish she&rsquo;d made it a bit clearer.</p>
