<p>The <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/30/the-rise-of-the-toilet-texter/">New York Times</a> recently reported that 91 percent of Americans aged 28-35 have used their mobile devices while on the toilet. Disturbingly, 20 percent of men and 13 percent of women have participated in a conference call from the john. Never before has the MUTE key played such an indispensable role.</p>

<p>Yet, while these statistics may leave you shaking your head in disgust (or not, if you&rsquo;re sitting on the throne while you read this), some companies are taking the initiative. Statistics can sometimes help you find a niche market, as the start-up <a href="http://hzo.me/">HzO</a> is no doubt counting on. They&rsquo;re developing a nanotechnology coating that will waterproof your phone. They were a big hit at CES, and are sure to make a splash in the industry this year.</p>

<p>I just wish they would be more honest in their marketing material. They talk about accidentally jumping in a pool with your phone in your pocket, or having an outdoor conversation during a torrential rain storm. The likelihood of these events happening are actually very minuscule. Why not just come out and say it - we are there to help when your phone goes plop. Full stop.</p>
