        <section id="main">
          <h5 id="date"> Thu Nov 19, 2015 </h5>
          <p>The choice came down to four phones: the <a href="/posts/2015-flagship-1-htc-one-m9/">HTC One M9</a>, the <a href="/posts/2015-flagship-2-samsung-galaxy-s6/">Samsung Galaxy S6</a>, the <a href="/posts/1271/">LG G4</a>, or the <a href="/posts/2015-flagship-4-iphone-6s/">iPhone 6s</a>. In actuality, a more stark dichotomy lay between Android and Apple, so the choice really came down to two very different approaches.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been living with both Android and iOS, so appreciate the merits of both operating systems. For me, hardware was a bigger consideration, as well as ongoing software support. I also didn&rsquo;t want a gigantic slab of a phone that seems to be the norm these days. So, in the end, I decided to go with the iPhone.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be honest - another factor in my decision was the company brand, and everything that brand stands for. For this reason, I didn&rsquo;t even consider Huawei&rsquo;s Nexus 6P, even though it seems very well made. People quickly forget, but Huawei has been suspected of <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5949821/chinas-biggest-telecomms-are-officially-national-security-risks-updated">spying for the Chinese government</a>, even though they, of course, deny it. On the other hand, Apple is well known for its stance on privacy and security, perhaps even more so under Tim Cook&rsquo;s reign. After all, Tim is an intensely private person, to the point where protecting people&rsquo;s data is almost a crusade for him.</p>

<p>Google has never had qualms about mining people&rsquo;s data to sell advertising, but I&rsquo;ve never had a huge problem with this. Probably because I&rsquo;ve come to believe Google&rsquo;s &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be evil&rdquo; mantra after using their services for such a long time.</p>

<p>In fact, most of Google&rsquo;s apps work beautifully on the iPhone - it seems pretty obvious that they don&rsquo;t care whether you buy an Android phone or iPhone, as long as you use their services.</p>

<p>Apple&rsquo;s beautiful hardware is one of the main reasons that people are willing to kill a whole pay cheque on an iPhone. The 6s is indeed a thing of beauty and is often imitated, sometimes to <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/10/27/9620318/htc-one-a9-review-android-iphone">a ridiculous degree</a>. Looking back, I had <a href="/posts/one-month-till-iphone-gets-here/">my eye on the original iPhone</a> before it even debuted - but for some reason, I stuck with my flip phone for another five years before trying out an Android phone as my first smartphone.</p>

<p>So, it was with great excitement that I unboxed my first iPhone. I didn&rsquo;t even turn it on until I&rsquo;d put a screen protector on it and inserted a new SIM.</p>

<p>Then, my heart broke a little.</p>

<p>I spotted a dead pixel in the lower-right corner of the screen. As you may know, once you see a dead pixel, you just can&rsquo;t un-see it. Especially when you just paid $1200 for a phone.</p>

<p>I took it into the Apple store the next day and they were willing to exchange it for a refurbished &ldquo;service phone&rdquo;, not a new out-of-the-box phone. Note-to-self: If I ever buy another Apple product, just get it at the store - not online. Apple stores can&rsquo;t exchange online purchases. My choices were to either return it for a service phone, or mail the phone back to Apple and wait a couple of weeks for a new replacement.</p>

<p>However, after some deliberation - involving a bizarre rambling monologue from a disgruntled Genius - a third option presented itself: to replace the entire LCD screen. So that&rsquo;s what I did - they could replace it at the store and it only took about an hour.</p>

<p>After using my new phone for a week, I&rsquo;ve been pleasantly surprised at how well the iPhone syncs up my other Apple products - namely my iMac, iPad, and Apple TV. I&rsquo;d never really considered this, but, until now, the iPhone was the only missing link in my personal Apple ecosystem (my second-gen iPod has long since ceased to be a contributing member of &ldquo;the family&rdquo;).</p>

<p>I could go on about how crispy the screen is or how insanely fast this thing is, but others have done so <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/9686/the-apple-iphone-6s-and-iphone-6s-plus-review">in far more detail</a>. But, yeah, this thing screams.</p>

<p>But, there have also been some unexpected, quite inexplicable niggles. The Alert volume, for example, is separate from the Ringtone volume, but can&rsquo;t be changed in the settings menu. I think you can change the Alert volume by playing some music and adjusting its volume, but I&rsquo;m not sure - either way, not very user friendly.</p>

<p>Also, I&rsquo;m baffled as to how I can back up my videos in their original resolution. Photostream uploads photos to the cloud, but not videos. And trying to use Dropbox to back up photos and videos doesn&rsquo;t work either because Apple doesn&rsquo;t allow Dropbox to run indefinitely in the background. Google photos does a good job, but downscales 4K videos to 1080p.</p>

<p>Fortunately, these are minor concerns that could someday be fixed in software. At the end of the day, a phone is just a tool. I know I&rsquo;ve made a big deal in this blog about my upgrade. And I expected to go be glued to my new phone the moment I got it - installing tons of apps and so on. But I haven&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Instead, the iPhone has sort of faded away into the background. It doesn&rsquo;t have a distractingly large screen. There are no widgets to fiddle with. But when called on to perform a task - it is on point; the iPhone does it well and it does it fast. Like a well-oiled weapon that never misfires - the iPhone can be counted on when you need it most.</p>
