          <p>I always say I&rsquo;m going to spend more time writing, but never do. Well, I mean it this time, and that means updating my journal more regularly. I&rsquo;ll freely admit that life is tough right now, but isn&rsquo;t it for everyone? I may as well share my angst. I wasn&rsquo;t going to post that last entry, which I cut and pasted from another &lsquo;secret&rsquo; journal, but I thought it was fittingly angst-ridden that I may as well go public with it.</p>

<p>By the way, for those of you looking for something racy and think that <em>sex in the city</em> is &ldquo;like, the best show <em>ever</em> (which I don&rsquo;t, but my girlfriend does), <a href="http://legallybored.blogspot.com/">check out this blog for some wit and girl talk from a very talented young writer.</a></p>

<p>What&rsquo;s happening? I recently turned 28 on the 11th, I had a nice birthday, the 11th is a public holiday in Canada (albeit a sombre one) which is great. My girlfriend took me out to dinner at the very popular Stepho&rsquo;s on Davie street for Greek food, we braved the inevitable line-up and stormed in with our hunger blazing. Good times, I&rsquo;m aging like fine wine over here.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s my job situation that&rsquo;s been giving me the real ups and downs. About a week ago I was fired from my morning teaching job. The students didn&rsquo;t like me so those back-stabbing bastards had me surreptitiously ousted in an act of clandestine mutiny. I really can&rsquo;t tell you what went wrong because communication levels in the ESL biz are notoriously circumvented. The students, of course, never said a word to me. From what I was told by second hand sources, I lacked the &ldquo;chemistry&rdquo; and the &ldquo;charisma&rdquo;. From this I&rsquo;ve concluded that I should never enter a beauty contest or run for office. Seriously though, what it came down to was just a bad fit. The students wanted to party and I wanted to teach and the whole thing failed miserably because I&rsquo;m just not a party animal. They did harp on about how they wish Korean was the &ldquo;world language&rdquo; because they hate learning English and are only doing it to get a good job back home. Needless to say, a tough job to motivate those kids, but I bowed out gracefully and there are no ill feelings, despite the slightly bitter tone I take here.</p>

<p>Today I had a bizarre interview at another school nearby for just a couple of hours a week. I say bizarre because it turned out that the school was owned by the same guy who sent me to Korea in the first place. The same guy whose father I serendipitously met up on Bhukansan. Well, needless to say, I thought I was &lsquo;in like Flynn&rsquo; with such a great networking connection. Well, I didn&rsquo;t get the job but the director of the school spend a good hour dissuading me from pursuing the ESL thing, citing the declining market, the lack of benefits and full time hours and so forth. All things, I might add, I saw my mother vigourously nodding her head to in my mind&rsquo;s eye as he went on about it. He was a very nice man and remarkably perceptive because he could gauge what type of person I was after just a few minutes. His suggestions were to go into business by myself as a tutor specializing in Grade 12 prep work or going back overseas to either Japan or Taiwan. For a Korean he seemed quite negative about Korea. He was saying something about the government encouraging young people to buy everything with credit a few years ago and only now discovering no-one could pay it back and losing lots of money caused an economic crisis. Huh? I can&rsquo;t say I know much about it but that sounds a little off the wall. So basically I need to make some tough choices. Keep gunning for that non-existent full time teaching position? Buy a car, develop some business savvy and become a full time tutor? Branch out into other areas? Go back to school? Work at the mall? Put on my steel-toed boots and head back to the warehouse? It&rsquo;s funny how time goes on the options get increasingly desperate until you&rsquo;re on the streets begging for spare change. Well, it&rsquo;s not quite that dramatic but I often question my ability to take an aggressive stance and initiate positive and constructive change in my life. I&rsquo;m too passive, I&rsquo;m a whiner, a daydreamer and I still have those anti-establishment sentiments I should have shed along with my university years where &lsquo;sticking it to the man&rsquo; was liberating as long as we lived off our student loans. All I know is, deep down inside (Hell, it&rsquo;s not even that deep down)I don&rsquo;t want to teach anymore, I&rsquo;m on the verge of hanging up my teacher&rsquo;s hat and putting <em>sunsangnim</em> to bed. The passion is gone, it&rsquo;s gone gone gone.</p>
