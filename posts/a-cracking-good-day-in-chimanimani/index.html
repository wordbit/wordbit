          <p>How disappointing, I’m up here on the mountain, drenched again. Yesterday, I attempted a walk in the afternoon and got so fucking wet on the way down, I literally had to wring my shoes out. Now I’m stupid enough to try it again. Thing is, I know if only the sun came out for half an hour, everything would be dry in no time at all.</p>

<p>People are dropping like flies from Malaria. They come through Mozambique and pick up those nasty strains and it only hits them when they reach Chimanimani.</p>

<p>Last night I drank some beers and smoked a joint with the silly English girls and some locals. I went to bed when they started smoking it up for real. I hate being stoned around people.</p>

<p>Now, should I carry on, or should I go back? Hmmmmm…</p>

<p>I started Indiana Jones yesterday: almost finished.</p>

<p>Later…</p>

<p>It actually turned out to be a cracking good day, weather-wise that is - I decided to forge on, and forge on, and I wasn’t too wet when I headed back - my clothes from yesterday still are.</p>

<p>I hadn’t realized how much I’m influenced by American culture until now, as I sit here listening to RATM and wearing my American clothes and thinking in American ways. While I was up the mountain, a lady came walking up the path balancing a huge bundle on her head. That’s hectic - I was wheezing my way up that mountain and cursing my satchel and she still had breath to greet me.</p>

<p>Who are all these people? There’s suddenly a bunch of people here. I think I’ve definitely decided to leave tomorrow - screw the cave, this weather is too unpredictable.</p>

<p>I’m going to try for the falls. This may be my only chance to see them, I think I should try…</p>
