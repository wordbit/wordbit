<p>When editing technical documents, how aware should you be of regional differences in pronunciation? Here is <a href="http://www.redhatmagazine.com/2007/02/26/how-to-write-really-good-documentationsemi-definite-rules-for-the-indefinite-article/">an interesting article</a> on the subject by Brian Forte. Forte raises the following issue regarding the usage of an indefinite article with initialisms:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How do you pronounce an initialism like HTML?</p>

<p>I was taught English in public Australian schools of the 1970s. So I was taught <em>aitch</em> rather than <em>haitch.</em> Which means I pronounce ‘HTML’ with an initial vowel sound and I write ‘an HTML page.’</p>

<p>If I’d gone to a private Irish Catholic school, however, I would have been taught <em>haitch</em> and would, naturally enough, think ‘a HTML page’ is correct.</p>

<p>More generally, <em>haitch</em> is standard in Hiberno-English and is a way for disputing Protestant and Catholic Northern Irelanders to distinguish themselves from each other.</p>

<p>So, if I insist on ‘an HTML page’ I’m telling 4.5 million English speakers their way of writing and speaking is wrong, or non-standard at the very least. And I can’t reveal accent by writing ‘an ’TML page’ because it’s a technical document, not a novel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seriously though, how many Irish Catholics are going to tear up their Linux manuals in disgust after discovering a pernicious &ldquo;an&rdquo; embedded in the text? It&rsquo;s nothing personal. Technical writers are just following a style guide. Some tech writers will go with &ldquo;a html&rdquo; because they look at the expanded form of the initialism. So &ldquo;a Hypertext Markup Language Page&rdquo; would be written as &ldquo;a html&rdquo;. Does that mean everybody who pronounces &ldquo;h&rdquo; as &ldquo;&lsquo;aitch&rdquo; (which is the majority of the English-speaking world) should label these writers as hate-mongering, prejudiced Irish Catholics?</p>

<p>It all comes down to schisms in pronunciation. Yet, in today&rsquo;s globalized world, there isn&rsquo;t much room to argue with the majority.</p>
