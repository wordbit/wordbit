          <p>I know the title doesn&rsquo;t make much sense, but I saw it painted on a garage door somewhere in Point Grey, and thought it was kind of cool. I&rsquo;ve just received an e-mail from Dean, the anthropologist I met at Mount Namsan - he&rsquo;s back in Melbourne! I guess all his plans to wander through India like a traveling ascetic was just all talk.</p>

<p>On Thursday night we went out to dinner at one of my student&rsquo;s parent&rsquo;s restaurants (Arnold). Arnold looks kind of like a little monkey and if you provoke him, even a little, he goes crazy and starts flailing his limbs about and screaming. His dad was at the restaurant and is also rather odd looking - I thought he resembled a Korean Mr. Bean. One of our bus drivers, usually quiet and reserved, turned out to be a raging comedian after a few beers and Sojus. Although I found him loud and obnoxious at the time, in retrospect I suppose he was rather amusing. I just don&rsquo;t gel well with abrasive personalities in general, and that night I was feeling a little sickly. So, as usually happens, after the restaurant we went to the beer Hof - a horrific American-style bar complete with pictures of &ldquo;I love Lucy&rdquo; and John Wayne in cowboy gear, a &ldquo;wierd-science&rdquo; style Budweiser beer lamp, and most offensive of all to my delicate anthropological sensibilities - a life-size bust of an American Indian in full head-dress mounted on the wall. After the bar, it was the Norae-bang of course (singing room), but I declined to participate, despite the repeated urgings of my co-workers. I hope Won Jang Nim wasn&rsquo;t too miffed at that, especially since she was paying for it and all. Koreans really love the Norae-bang, apparently Sulu even saw one chap who outfitted the back of his SUV as a miniature Norae-bang, with TV screens, a disco-ball and everything. Meanwhile, Mr. bus driver quickly adopted us as his best friends and instructed us to communicate in body language only, belting out &ldquo;Canada-good&rdquo; or &ldquo;Canada-bad&rdquo;, depending on how fast I was drinking. Sigh. I&rsquo;m rather useless at participating in the male Korean drinking culture, although Sulu, being a robust Samoan girl, drank him under the table, much to my gratification.</p>

<p>On Friday was the birthday party and nobody ate too much cake, nobody threw up, and it all went quite smoothly. Johnny is turning seven this month (Korean age - five or six in Western age). Johnny is the coolest kid. We have a playground on top of the roof of our building - and in Gym time, Timothy tried to kick the soccer ball but his shoe flew off and almost hit someone on the street below. I thought that was funny as hell. Yesterday we went shopping at the factory outlet stores in Ilsan - I&rsquo;m not a big consumer, but it is tempting over here where buying stuff is such a big part of the way of life.
Debbie asked me to write an article for the Wonderland journal, it&rsquo;s an internal publication, but I tried to write something straddling the line between brute honesty and Wonderland propaganda. Before I came to Korea, I heard that Hokwans were kind of like babysitting jobs, and you&rsquo;ll read this a lot on the net, but it&rsquo;s not really. although the learning curve of the young ones is really slow. I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s more like a cross between a lion-tamer and a politician. I don&rsquo;t know, it depends on what you want to get out of it, and I don&rsquo;t mind it so much because I really like the kids, although it is hard sometimes.</p>

<p>Anyways, I&rsquo;ve added a poetry link to my web-page, but I must warn you, it&rsquo;s still under construction.</p>
