        <section id="main">
          <h5 id="date"> Thu Mar 24, 2022 </h5>
          <p>Thank you, Apple, for giving me something to write about besides from today&rsquo;s unholy trinity of war, disease, and inflation.</p>

<p>Perhaps not as flashy as last year&rsquo;s <a href="/posts/spring-loaded/">Spring Loaded</a> digital event, <a href="https://youtu.be/CUwg_JoNHpo">Peek Performance</a> was nonetheless a nice, mellow start to the 2022 Apple news cycle. And was also another opportunity for Apple&rsquo;s chip team to flex hard.</p>

<p>This presentation was a no-nonsense, all-business affair. Given the complete lack of levity, especially from a dead-eyed Tim Cook, you get the feeling Apple is ready to move on from pre-recorded video and return to in-person events.</p>

<p>I have to give Apple inclusivity credit though - most of the presenters were women this time and they were all lively and engaging.</p>

<p>So, I&rsquo;m going to continue a tradition here and give my &ldquo;thumbs up&rdquo; and &ldquo;thumbs down&rdquo; impressions of each announcement as I did in last year&rsquo;s Spring event.</p>

<p>Here we go.</p>

<p></p>

<h3 id="friday-night-baseball">Friday Night Baseball</h3>

<p>Apple is bringing live Baseball games to Apple TV+ &ldquo;free from local broadcast restrictions&rdquo;.</p>

<p><img src="/images/thumbs_up.png" align="left"> Dipping a pinky toe into live streaming could be the start of exciting developments for sports-loving cord cutters. Cable-network executives have another reason to lose sleep - assuming they aren&rsquo;t blind to the writing on the wall. Live sports and news - the last bastion of traditional cable.</p>

<p><img src="/images/thumbs_down.png" align="left"> I&rsquo;m not into Baseball, so maybe the yawns for this announcement are solely my own. Even so, a minor announcement like this belongs in a Press Release rather than in a tech event.</p>

<h3 id="green-iphone-13-colours">Green iPhone 13 colours</h3>

<p>The iPhone 13 gets a new &ldquo;green&rdquo; finish (yes, just &ldquo;green&rdquo;) and the iPhone 13 Pro gets the more sophisticated-sounding &ldquo;alpine green&rdquo; (as it is obviously more fancy).</p>

<p><img src="/images/thumbs_up.png" align="left"> Well, more colour choices are always nice for the Spring. And I think having both blue and green in the lineup is a good balance of natural colours inspired by nature. I&rsquo;m reaching here, I know.</p>

<p><img src="/images/thumbs_down.png" align="left"> For some reason, green-painted technology looks disgusting. There&rsquo;s a reason, after all, that green is one of the least-popular car colours. Maybe there are a few who actually dig it, but I couldn&rsquo;t imagine a green option sparking a resurgence in iPhone sales.</p>

<h3 id="new-iphone-se">New iPhone SE</h3>

<p>The new iPhone SE features the A15 chip, 5G, a slightly better battery life, and stronger glass - all in the body of an iPhone 8.</p>

<p><img src="/images/thumbs_up.png" align="left"> Notch haters and home-button lovers are going to be very happy this form factor is still around. Compact, capable, and long lasting are good words to describe the SE. I&rsquo;m more than familiar with the &ldquo;iconic&rdquo; design, having only recently moved on from my iPhone 6S. This entry-level iPhone, however, is three times faster than the 6S.</p>

<p><img src="/images/thumbs_down.png" align="left"> Maybe kids and grandparents won&rsquo;t complain when they&rsquo;re handed the SE, but there&rsquo;s a reason anyone who is employed has moved on (myself included) to the newer iPhone X-era design. The tiny display, small battery, and single camera in the SE add up to a tired old form factor that is not worth $650 CAD you&rsquo;ll be paying (after tax).</p>

<p>If Apple supports this SE as long as they supported the 6S, you&rsquo;ll still be pulling this retro tech out of your pocket in 2029. Just think of the looks you&rsquo;ll get from all the cool kids wearing their AR glasses.</p>

<h3 id="ipad-air-5">iPad Air 5</h3>

<p>Iterating on the excellent iPad Air 4 re-design introduced in 2020, this year&rsquo;s model includes the blazing-fast M1 chip, a 12MP front camera, and a fetching new blue colour.</p>

<p><img src="/images/thumbs_up.png" align="left"> When the iPad Air 4 came out, I was <a href="/posts/from-the-insane-to-the-mundane/">sorely tempted</a> to snap one up and toss my OG 2013 iPad Air away. The iPad Air 5 tempts me even more. There&rsquo;s no doubt that the iPad Air 5&rsquo;s real value proposition here is Apple&rsquo;s delicious homemade M1 chip. Ironically, you don&rsquo;t even need that much power for an iPad. But what the M1 gives you is longevity - if you invest in one of these, you&rsquo;ll probably be good for the next decade.</p>

<p><img src="/images/thumbs_down.png" align="left"> The frustrating thing for people my age is the expectation that the iPad should do more. But maybe it will never be a &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; computer where you can run software outside of the App Store or hook up a keyboard and mouse and expect next-level multitasking. But kids love the iPad. A touch interface is probably going to surpass older interaction models at some point in the future.</p>

<p>Personally, I&rsquo;m convinced that the iPad is a great casual device for watching YouTube, scrolling on Twitter, or shopping on Amazon. But you can do all these things on an iPhone too. The overlap doesn&rsquo;t quite justify the new iPad Air&rsquo;s cost for me, as lovely as it is.</p>

<p>So, I guess I&rsquo;ll keep my decade-old iPad Air until the day that the YouTube and Netflix apps are no longer supported. Or until I have so much money that I don&rsquo;t know what else to spend it on, which doesn&rsquo;t seem likely (see third member of unholy trinity: inflation).</p>

<p>Also, rumours have it that Apple was planning on bringing OLED to the iPad Air 5, but this upgrade got pushed to another year, which is a bummer. I do have a thing for OLED, so maybe next year the temptation will become too hard to bear&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="mac-studio">Mac Studio</h3>

<p>So, the Mac Studio is a brand new product, but is basically a taller Mac mini with beefed-up internals and extra ports.</p>

<p><img src="/images/thumbs_up.png" align="left"> The neat trick in this product is that Apple&rsquo;s chip team connected two M1 Maxes together to form the &ldquo;M1 Ultra&rdquo;. With a smoking-fast bandwidth of 2.5 terabytes between the chips, the two chips appear to the system as one super-powered chip. So, double the speed, double the memory, and double the performance. Really nice, especially if you&rsquo;ve always wanted 128GB of RAM for some insane reason.</p>

<p><img src="/images/thumbs_down.png" align="left"> Apple&rsquo;s marketing team is having a field day with their chip names, which are, quite frankly, getting out of control. But, that&rsquo;s a minor complaint. These are impressive, compact machines. But the Mac Studio is such a niche product that it won&rsquo;t have a broad impact until the chip improvements trickle down to the consumer landscape. Starting at $2500 CAD, these aren&rsquo;t exactly a bargain, especially considering they are nowhere near as modular as PC builds.</p>

<h3 id="studio-display">Studio Display</h3>

<p>Apple is positioning this new 27-inch 5K display as a companion to the Mac Studio.</p>

<p><img src="/images/thumbs_up.png" align="left"> Nobody does a 5K display like Apple does. To be fair, nobody does a 5K display period (except for LG). With great built-in speakers, a webcam, terrific build quality, and a lower price than Apple&rsquo;s $6,000+ Pro Display XDR, you&rsquo;d think that Apple has a winner on their hands.</p>

<p><img src="/images/thumbs_down.png" align="left"> Apple does not have a winner on their hands. Leaving aside reports of a bad, blotchy webcam (Apple claims they can fix it in a software update), this display has a lacklustre spec sheet for the two-grand asking price. These days $2,000 CAD will get you a cutting-edge OLED with HDR, local dimming zones, and a high-refresh rate. The Studio Display has none of these things.</p>

<p>So, what exactly is the Studio Display? The short answer is that it&rsquo;s a rip off. Apple recycled the 2014 Retina iMac, kept the display, tore the computer out the back, and charged more for it. I&rsquo;ll gladly pay for great engineering. The iPhone is a delightful fusion of hardware and software that is worth a thousand bucks. But you&rsquo;d have to be unthinkably brand loyal to buy this Apple display. My advice?
