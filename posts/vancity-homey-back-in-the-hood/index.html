          <p>Today I realized I actually am experiencing some sort of reverse culture shock. The thing is, with all the traveling I&rsquo;ve done, I&rsquo;m insensitive to the symptoms, sort of like when you get a cold. You&rsquo;ve had a cold so many times before that most of the time you&rsquo;re not cognizant of being ill until you hack up some flem or have to blow your nose.</p>

<p>After a few false starts, Jenny and I drove downtown and briefly checked out the beach; the wind was howling like a wounded banshee&hellip;it was so beautiful&hellip;walked down Robson and went shopping <em>grimace</em>&hellip;It was awesome to check out the old haunts, but I definitely feel weird and disconnected, like a tourist. I remember living downtown clearly, but place-names and small details are hard to recall, like trying to remember a dream&hellip; Part of it is that I don&rsquo;t really know anyone in Vancouver anymore, all the friends I had here have all moved away at some point, leaving Vancouver like a pristine queen, chillingly beautiful but superficial, inaccessible, this city holds you away at arms length and says &ldquo;admire me, I&rsquo;m beautiful but don&rsquo;t get too close&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s hard to explain these feelings where everything is so familiar yet foreign&hellip;where new aspects of the city are revealed to me at certain times and places&hellip;the pristine queen is constantly trying on new dresses and her mood shifts and changes unpredictably.</p>

<p>Anyways, we hooked up with Jenny&rsquo;s friend, Ahmin, sorry dude I can&rsquo;t spell your name, he&rsquo;s a really cool guy with an insane sense of humour, likes to find peoples buttons and push them, but not in a malicious way - more like shock therapy to get people to confront their issues. We went for the all-you-can-eat-sushi at Tanpopos, that awesome Sushi place on Denman. It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve had grade-A Vancity style sushi, I was in heaven!</p>

<p>One thing that amazed me was all the Korean I started seeing around Vancouver, now that I can read it, it just pops out at you and I&rsquo;ve discovered there&rsquo;s loads of <em>PC-bangs</em> and Korean movie stores and restaurants of course. The writing seemed so out of context and really exemplified for me the vast differences between what constitutes &ldquo;Asian culture&rdquo; over here and what it&rsquo;s <em>really</em> like over there. It&rsquo;s awesome that Vancouver is so &ldquo;Asian&rdquo; though&hellip;just being in a heterogeneous society again is so refreshing and provides a rich sort of variety that I was missing in <em>the hermit kingdom</em>. Even in the Japanese restaurant I felt compelled to bow copiously and wanted to burst out in Korean to the waiters - <em>Yogi Yo! Yogi Yo! Mul juseyo!</em>, which just shows you how confused I am, a white guy bellowing in Korean in a Japanese restaurant in the West End. I think it&rsquo;s going to take a while&hellip;</p>
