          <p>I&rsquo;m too busy to do much these days although I did manage to play a game of Scrabble in the bar with Sky last night. I had a strong start, but after a few beers, my lexical abilities correspondingly decreased to the point where I was laboriously spelling out the word &ldquo;c-a-t&rdquo; on the board for a measly five points.</p>

<p>The whole deal with Dean fell through, which means I not only have to tell him he&rsquo;s not going to have a job when he gets here and that his original degree certificate is sitting here in a backwater Korean town, but I lose out on the $300 recruiting bonus. Major, major bummer. What makes it worse is that he&rsquo;s on some anthropological stint somewhere in the jungles of Vietnam right now and it&rsquo;s impossible to get hold of him. He&rsquo;s going to have a nice surprise when he gets here. The immigration office denied his request for a Visa because when he was here last time he copped out of his last contract after a month. They must be getting stricter on who they let in these days. Still, it&rsquo;s not like he was fired or anything, he went home for &lsquo;personal reasons&rsquo;. Our supervisor, &ldquo;D&rdquo;, was already showing another potential teacher around hours after the immigration office called.</p>

<p>Speaking of &ldquo;D&rdquo;  - today she blamed me, albeit in jest, for the fact that the Kitten class &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t scared of the teachers&rdquo;. What am I supposed to do!? Intercept them in the parking lot and threaten to beat them into submission? Threatening phone-calls? Give them a thrashing and tell them they&rsquo;d better get used to it because they&rsquo;re going to get slapped around in Elementary school? No thanks. Actually I think it&rsquo;s healthy to let them defy authority, it encourages free thought.</p>

<p>Today one of my students gave me some walnuts in their shell in celebration of the full moon. Apparently the lunar new year operates on a fifteen day cycle and it isn&rsquo;t over yet. The scanty explanations proffered by the students and teachers have left me a little confused. Apparently people go out and play games under the light of the full moon and&hellip; pray to the moon? Or send their wishes to the moon?  It&rsquo;s kind of hard to tell what&rsquo;s going on, but the walnut shell is perfectly round like the full moon is this evening, so I can see a connection there. When I left Canada, I had visions of engaging in some amateur fieldwork over here, but without speaking the language it&rsquo;s been pretty useless. I haven&rsquo;t managed to gain much of an insider&rsquo;s perspective at all, although, obviously I&rsquo;ve run into a lot of <em>opinions</em> about various cultural aspects from just about everybody, Korean and non-Korean alike.</p>
