          <p><em>In the middle of the flood-ravaged Northern Province on the bus…</em></p>

<p>Well, we just scraped through Beitbridge before it closed, but some of the roads were impassable and the bus broke down, so this bus will be 14 hours late.</p>

<p>Add that on to the 12 hours already travelled and that makes for a long journey with very sore legs/back/neck. Serves me right for barging through the worst floods in 50 years. Leaving thousands homeless. Perpetuating diseases like Cholera and Malaria. Africa.</p>

<p>Yeah, so that address at the top [redacted] is a guy from Quebec City, in case I ever go there. Really nice guy. I’ve met so many great people on this trip. I wish I could have afforded to go to Malawi and Tanzania.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I phoned Colleen, read the paper, and my taxi that I called never pitched. So I had to run out into the street and flag down a minibus which took me as far as Fife St. Then I ran (with my luggage) the rest of the way. You know I couldn’t backpack if I was much older. Anyway, I managed to catch this bus to hell and it looks like I’ll be on it a while yet.</p>

<p>I must do some email soon. Maybe not a long one at Colleen’s ‘cause they’re too hospitable and have too many people taking advantage of that. I should contact some key people, like parents, to let them know I’m okay.</p>

<p>Much, much later…</p>

<p>I’m sitting here at this fucking station in Joburg without a ride. Got in about eight hours after expected. Phoned Colleen and her maid told me she’s sleeping - I think she’s too afraid to wake her up. Feel really bad about imposing on them - there are buses to Durban tomorrow, but I don&rsquo;t have any money, so I would have to borrow and pay back. Thomas Cooke closes at four and they have no commission. I think I must phone again in ten minutes. I don’t want to sit here for another two hours. I’m so knackered.</p>

<p>All&rsquo;s well that ends well…</p>

<p>Just had a hot bath and a shave and washed my hair and ate chops and sweet potatoes, Italian sweet kisses and drank two beers… I feel absolutely heavenly!</p>

<p>Colleen finally came and picked me up, then she dropped me off near Killarney Mall. I went in and changed money and booked my Durban bus for tomorrow morning. Caught a bus back here. Managed to get Gareth to pick me up tomorrow after a few calls to others who couldn’t on such short notice. Good guy, really good guy.</p>

<p>Checked my emails - had 16 messages. Nothing too exciting happening in Vancouver as usual. Not the drama here with floods and power struggles with greedy dictators. They closed Beitbridge today, so I really did just squeeze through before the Limpopo swamped the bridge.</p>
