          <p><em>This post contains spoilers (at the end). Read on at your own risk.</em></p>

<p><em>Interstellar</em> takes on black holes, relativity, and the politics of space exploration - grounding these topics in an emotional and gut-wrenching family drama. It&rsquo;s a great movie.</p>

<p>Among the various weighty philosophical questions posed in this Christopher Nolan epic, one stands out - are we alone in the universe? I&rsquo;d like to frame the movie around this question alone. So, you see, this is only sort of an <em>Interstellar</em> review.</p>

<p>The universe is unimaginably vast, yet we have yet to find any life outside our own planet. Well, that&rsquo;s not quite true - the &ldquo;unimaginably&rdquo; part I mean. Plenty of imaginative thinkers have come up with numbers that will blow your mind. Tim Urban is such a thinker - <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html">check out his post</a> for an extremely comprehensive read on this subject. Also check out <a href="http://io9.com/is-it-time-to-accept-that-were-alone-in-the-universe-1654960619">this i09 post</a>.</p>

<p>So yeah, maybe extinction events are more common than we&rsquo;d like. Or maybe we are of the first emerging sentient species in the universe. Or maybe we aren&rsquo;t mature enough to join the United Federation of Planets and the Prime Directive prohibits any superior species from making first contact with us. There are a lot of maybes.</p>

<p>There are a lot of questions too. What are the chances that any intelligent aliens out there are humanoid, animals, or even organic? Or that these aliens have developed a similar cultural and sociological value system that places emphasis on altruism and exploration? Or that their method of interpersonal and interstellar communication even closely resembles ours?</p>

<p>With so much uncertainty about anything that exists beyond our exosphere, there are a lot of theories out there on what is called &ldquo;The Great Silence&rdquo;. Personally, I love the theory put forward in<a href="http://www.galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html"> The Egg</a>, a wonderful short story by Andy Weir.</p>

<p>What strikes me as extremely arrogant though, is that we don&rsquo;t just ascribe our failure to simple human deficiency. I mean, we threw hundreds of millions of dollars into finding Flight MH370, a plane that disappeared into a relatively defined area of the Indian Ocean, and came up empty-handed. So why assume that we can so easily find intelligent life in an <em>infinite</em> universe?</p>

<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know if aliens exist or if Jesus can turn Coke into Pepsi. What I do know is that when we throw reasonable science or dogmatic religion aside and just think outside the box, then we have ourselves some excellent cerebral entertainment. And that&rsquo;s what <em>Interstellar</em> is.</p>

<p>In <em>Interstellar</em>, a benevolent alien presence opens up a wormhole somewhere in the vicinity of Saturn. This same alien presence manifests itself as a poltergeist in a rambling old farmhouse by throwing books off of shelves and manipulating the downward floating trajectory of dust.</p>

<p>By the end of the movie, we discover that these aliens are actually ourselves in a distant future where we have evolved / transcended into beings of the fifth dimension who can manipulate time and space. Well, technically the protagonist of the movie is actually the ghost because he ends up in a construct of the 5th dimension by flying into a black hole, but I don&rsquo;t want to overcomplicate it - cause really, it makes sense when you watch it.</p>

<p>But to answer the original question - are we alone in the universe? In <em>Interstellar</em>, it seemed there were intelligent extraterrestrials aiding us, but they were just humans. Or were once humans. So, the answer is yes, we are alone. Although just a movie, this premise seems realistic to us.</p>

<p>The truth is that we are such megalomaniacs, we have an easier time believing that we can become omnipresent gods in the far-flung future than believing there is some sort of alternative intelligence in this universe. An intelligence so far removed from our own that it is simply incomprehensible to us. I&rsquo;m not sure yet if this is a failure of imagination or an unbridled imagination.</p>

<p>If we ever find Flight MH370, then maybe we can talk about how intelligent we are. In the meantime, just enjoy <em>Interstellar</em> because it actually is a fantastic movie - two thumbs up.</p>
