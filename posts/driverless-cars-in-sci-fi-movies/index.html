        <section id="main">
          <h5 id="date"> Sat Feb 14, 2015 </h5>
          <p>Cars are so integral to American culture, that it&rsquo;s no surprise they often appear in Hollywood movies about the future. But with self-driving cars rapidly gaining traction (sorry) in the public imagination, we are getting a better idea of what a realistic future of autonomous vehicles may look like. So, the question is, which science fiction movies got it right, and who got it wrong?</p>

<p>Before we can answer this question, we need to establish a few things.</p>

<p>Firstly, we need to determine a plausible future date where the majority of vehicles on the road will be autonomous. Navigant, a market research think tank, has studied the emerging technology of self-driving cars and has <a href="https://www.navigantresearch.com/newsroom/three-quarters-of-vehicles-sold-in-2035-are-expected-to-have-autonomous-capability">concluded</a> that by 2035, at least 75 percent of all cars sold will be autonomous. So, let&rsquo;s go with that general time frame as the future date when self-driving cars are more or less mainstream.</p>

<p>Secondly, we will be focusing exclusively on American science fiction movies, so any depictions of self-driving cars in other genres or mediums is out. So, no <em>Christine</em>, arguably the most terrifying depiction of a driverless car. And no Benny the Cab from <em>Who Framed Roger Rabbit</em>, or <em>Herby</em>, even if they are pretty cute sentient cars. And, although Kitt from <em>Knight Rider</em> is actually a pretty realistic autonomous vehicle, he appears on television. But Kitt is still awesome, even if the 80s are long gone, so it would be remiss not to mention him.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the science fiction movie in question should sincerely attempt to depict our future society, although there is room for some artistic license of course. The movie is usually set in a specific year, so that will be taken into account when comparing the depicted year with our proposed 2035 date.</p>

<p><strong>Who got it wrong:</strong></p>

<p>Here are the movies that didn&rsquo;t quite hit the mark (in chronological order).</p>

<p><strong>Timecop (set in 2004)</strong></p>

<p><img src="/images/timecop.jpg" alt="Timecop" /></p>

<p>The voice-controlled driverless cars in Timecop not only look hideous but arrived too early in our timeline. We didn&rsquo;t even have the iPhone in 2004.</p>

<p><strong>Interstellar (set in 2034)</strong></p>

<p><img src="/images/interstellar.jpg" alt="interstellar" /></p>

<p>Okay, so 2034 is one year shy of our 2035 date. But, still. I find it hard to believe the amazing aerospace tech shown in the movie, as well as the tech in autonomous drones, and fully-fledged AI robots didn&rsquo;t filter down to the auto industry.</p>

<p><strong>Gattaca (set in the mid to late 21st century)</strong></p>

<p><img src="/images/gattaca.jpg" alt="gattaca" /></p>

<p>The cars that Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke drive are definitely stylish, but come off as decidedly old school. In a society dedicated to creating perfect humans through genetic engineering, you&rsquo;d think they would also pimp their rides too.</p>

<p><strong>Total Recall (set in 2084)</strong></p>

<p><img src="/images/total_recall.jpg" alt="total_recall" /></p>

<p>Total Recall did predict driverless cars, so no problem there. But the creepy android taxi driver is just comical (which suits the tone of the movie, I guess). But seriously, everybody knows skeuomorphism is so 2007.</p>

<p><strong>Judge Dredd (set in 2139)</strong></p>

<p><img src="/images/judge_dredd.jpg" alt="judge_dredd" /></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s 124 years in the future and not only do people still drive themselves around but a futuristic douchebag gets busted for DUI - an unlikely occurrence in a future where the designated driver should be an anachronism. So unrealistic.</p>

<p><strong>Who got it right:</strong></p>

<p>Here are the movies that nailed it, also in chronological order.</p>

<p><strong>Demolition Man (set in 2032)</strong></p>

<p><img src="/images/demolitionman.jpg" alt="DemolitionMan" /></p>

<p>A few years shy of 2035, but Sandra Bullock demonstrates an extremely believable scenario when she takes a video chat in her autonomous police car, complete with a Siri-like voice assistant. Cheesy movie, but the car tech is spot on.</p>

<p><strong>I, Robot (set in 2035)</strong></p>

<p><img src="/images/irobot.jpg" alt="iRobot" /></p>

<p>The futuristic Audi that Will Smith drives in <em>I, Robot</em> is simply badass. This autonomous car actually feels quite familiar and is entirely believable. And look at the year when this movie is set - 2035! Bang on.</p>

<p><strong>Minority Report (set in 2054)</strong></p>

<p><img src="/images/minority_report.jpg" alt="Minority Report" style="width: 800px;"/></p>

<p>The driverless cars in this awesome movie are super high-tech and even deliver you straight to your condo window by driving up the side of the building. Perhaps a little ambitious for only 39 years from now, but probably the coolest depiction of autonomous vehicles in any sci-fi movie.</p>

<p><strong>Logan&rsquo;s Run (set in 2274)</strong></p>

<p><img src="/images/logansrun.jpg" alt="logansrun" /></p>

<p>You have to give props to a movie that came out in 1976 but accurately predicted the advent of the autonomous vehicle. And that design has definitely stood the test of time, although maybe doesn&rsquo;t have the best crash-test ratings.</p>

<p>These movies offer an intriguing glimpse into the possible future of autonomous vehicles. If I was to announce a winner, however, I&rsquo;d probably go with <em>I, Robot</em> for believability and for fitting perfectly in the proposed timeframe. One thing is for sure, if I make it to 2035, I&rsquo;ll be looking back on this blog post and writing a follow-up post to discuss what actually panned out!</p>
