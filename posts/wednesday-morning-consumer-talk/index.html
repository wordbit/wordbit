          <p>Just a quick update&hellip; Nothing extraordinary has happened recently, but I did get a haircut, which is always an adventure. This time I asked Sora to come with me and translate because last time I just looked up &lsquo;short&rsquo; in the dictionary and hoped they would get the idea. It didn&rsquo;t turn out too well. This time wasn&rsquo;t much better, mostly because most Korean men get the same haircut (the infamous &lsquo;line&rsquo;), and it&rsquo;s hard trying to communicate the concept of &lsquo;tapering&rsquo;, even with a translator. Speaking of hair, in my adult class (composed entirely of women), I noticed one of them had her hair permed, so I complimented her on her new hairstyle. Immediately following the compliment, a chorus of &lsquo;me too!&rsquo; erupted and several other women eagerly showed me their new hairstyle. Sure enough, most of the class had their hair newly permed. I wonder if there was a pioneer in this mass perming, or if it was a spontaneous trend. Anyways, I also bought some new glasses yesterday, glasses here are dirt cheap compared to Canada, and the eye exam is free. I splashed out and got the highest index lenses with all the bells and whistles and a new frame and it only came to the equivalency of around a hundred bucks Canadian. The same pair in Canada would have set me back four hundred bucks at least. Tomorrow we are supposed to go on a field trip, but Debbie is adamant that a storm is on it&rsquo;s way. I&rsquo;m not looking forward to next month when Summer classes start because we get extra morning classes. That means eleven to twelve hour days every day for a month. I&rsquo;ve never worked this hard in my life! Debbie said she &lsquo;stared at the schedule for a long time&rsquo; but couldn&rsquo;t change anything.</p>
