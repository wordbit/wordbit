<p>Resolution #27: Sort through the 250 unread emails in my inbox.</p>

<p>That dreaded resolution sound familiar? How about taking it one step further and eliminating email altogether? A few weeks ago the IT firm <a href="http://atos.net/en-us/">Atos</a> made waves when they revealed they were phasing out internal emails in favour of other networking tools. That got me thinking that email is dying a slow death for personal use as well.</p>

<p>Email was invented in 1972 and has had a good run, but it&rsquo;s time to move on. Let&rsquo;s take a look at the facts:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Texting and IM has become more of the norm.</p></li>

<li><p>Networks like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn allow you to stay in touch with friends and colleagues.</p></li>

<li><p>Email newsletters are dying in the face of highly personalized reading tools like Google Reader, Flipboard, and Instapaper.</p></li>

<li><p>Free organizational tools like Evernote allows you to create tagged notes and task-oriented lists. No need to email yourself anymore.</p></li>

<li><p>Web browsers like Firefox can be synced so that all your bookmarks, history, etc. is available on any computer.</p></li>

<li><p>Smartphones offer instant notifications from all of the above and has become the communication nexus for most people (no pun intended).</p></li>

<li><p>Official organizations like your bank or the government won&rsquo;t even touch email because of security issues. Yep, still a fax or phone call for these guys.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>That leaves email as nothing more than a digital garbage can for junk mail. And who wants to waste their precious time being an online janitor? Not many. So forgive your grand-kids for laughing at this quaint &ldquo;email&rdquo; you tell them about - it&rsquo;s just so 70s, man.</p>
