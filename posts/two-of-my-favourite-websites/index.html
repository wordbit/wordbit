<p>If you want to see how a movie fared with the critics before you shell out your hard-earned bucks, check out <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/">rotten tomatoes</a>. This popular website has recently been redesigned and has now gone into beta testing.</p>

<p>The new design isn&rsquo;t bad, but then again, I didn&rsquo;t have a problem with the old one either. I guess they were trying to go with a more community-based, web 2.0 format. The layout is still a bit cluttered, but looks lighter.</p>

<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s not the design that draws me to the site again and again, it&rsquo;s the concept. Rotten tomatoes gathers critic reviews from across the country and adds them up. Enough positive reviews gives the movie a &ldquo;fresh&rdquo; rating, and too many negative ones garner a &ldquo;rotten&rdquo; rating. A sidebar on the home page lists current box office movies so that you can figure out what&rsquo;s worth watching at a glance. If you want to search for a movie, type it in the search box and within seconds you can see if you should pop that movie into your DVD player or toss it into the returns bin.</p>

<p>Another website I dig is <a href="http://www.wired.com/">wired news</a>, and again I go there mostly because the content is interesting and is regularly updated. At wired news, you can read the latest headlines in technology, cyberculture, and our digital lives.</p>

<p>Ease of navigation makes this site a delight to visit. Large, bold headlines are easy to read and if they catch your attention, you&rsquo;re just one click away from reading the entire article. For those who like a little visual stimulation with their serving of words, there are plenty of well-chosen pictures to capture your attention and, in many cases, persuade you to read the article.</p>
