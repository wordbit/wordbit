<p>Steve Jobs passed away yesterday. What is there to say about a  visionary who changed the way we interact with our computers,  communicate, listen to music, or even appreciate the beauty of typeface.  There is so much to say that has been said more eloquently by others. I  am greatly saddened, as are so many others, by the loss of such a  powerhouse in the tech world.</p>

<p>Yet, although he has left us with many cool toys like iMacs,  iPhones, and iPads, it is his inspiration which is a far greater legacy.  Steve was uncompromising, sometimes to a fault, in living each day to  the fullest. He followed his heart, his passion, his gut. He was crazy  enough to believe he could change the world, and so he did. The way he  owned the public stage with such exuberance and enthusiasm for his  creations was infectious. He was, unapologetically and wholeheartedly,  doing what he loved to do.</p>

<p>Goodbye Steve, and thank you. Thanks for showing us that  following your dreams is more important than all the money or fame or  gadgets in the world.</p>
