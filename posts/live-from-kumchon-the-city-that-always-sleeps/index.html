          <p>Last night we went drinking at &ldquo;The Posse&rdquo;. I last went there a few months ago with the cowboy Sean. There are lots of surreal kinds of &lsquo;American&rsquo; bars in this town I&rsquo;ve noticed. Pirates and Indians seem to be huge cultural icons (stereotypes) and a must when planning the interior decorating. The bartender/owner Storm still works there, he&rsquo;s pretty cool, mostly because he understands what drinks you&rsquo;re ordering. We also went to &ldquo;The Sunset&rdquo;, which has been renamed &ldquo;rpm 8000&rdquo; and doesn&rsquo;t have live music anymore, just a lot of fairy lights and an odd smell. Sulu was happy though because of the behemoth bourbon and cokes. What can I say, Kumchon doesn&rsquo;t have a lot to offer but at least you can always get a table.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on my web-site a bit, mostly just making everything garish and multi-coloured, but hey, it&rsquo;s a work in progress. I&rsquo;ve made my poetry page somewhat Smashing Pumpkins-ish, probably because I&rsquo;m listening to them right now. It looks cool, even though I&rsquo;ve yet to add some more material. And I&rsquo;ve added six more photographs to my photo gallery. <a href="http://www.wordbit.freehostia.com/geocities/">So check it out right now!</a></p>

<p>Today the only person I spoke to was a clown on the street who was making animal balloons outside my supermarket. I think he was promoting a new DVD store. But who can tell really, I&rsquo;m still living in a state of perpetual confusion without that handy thing called <em>language</em> to guide my perceptions of the world. To his chagrin, I refused one of his balloons on the way in, so on the way out of the market he made a sword balloon and tried to engage me in a balloon-sword duel. I took his balloon and gave it to some kids. To be honest I&rsquo;ve been feeling rather delicate today because of last night&rsquo;s stress relieving drinking therapy. At least it&rsquo;s cooled down a bit, largely because of some heavy rains sweeping down from China. Oops, weather talk, best end this.</p>
