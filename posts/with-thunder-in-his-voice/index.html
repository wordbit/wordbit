          <p>This topic interests me because I lived for a year in South Korea in a little town close to the border. I went up to the border on more than one occasion and even have a piece of the barbed wire fence dividing North and South Korea. I&rsquo;m waiting for re-unification. That piece of wire could be as momentous as having a piece of the Berlin wall. Anyway, if you have a minute to spare, <a href="http://video.google.ca/videoplay?docid=3813036076281028527&amp;q=kim+jong+il">check out this hilarious example of North Korean propaganda</a>. In North Korea, legend has it that Kim Jong Il was born on top of a sacred mountain. The clouds opened up, and he came down from heaven&hellip;</p>

<p>In reality, Kim Jong Il was born in a Russian military camp. I should point out that the above video would be taken quite seriously in North Korea. If you have more time, then be sure to watch <a href="http://video.google.ca/videoplay?docid=3787046457101273554&amp;q=north+korea">this fascinating documentary on Kim Jong Il and the Nuclear arms conflict</a>. What I found especially fascinating is the way he infuses spiritual determinism into his political platform. He has set himself up as a sort of deity who is a father figure to the North Korean people. This representation is entirely congruent with Confucian ideology on hierarchical family structures where the nation is equal to a family and the father must always be obeyed.</p>

<p>Kim Jong Il started out in the communist party making propaganda movies and musicals and was said to have a lot of &ldquo;girlfriends&rdquo; in the industry. It&rsquo;s incredible that there are still dictators like this in the world.</p>
