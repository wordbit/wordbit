          <p><em>On the train… the next morning.</em></p>

<p>Well, I was the only one having the three-course fiasco last night, so it was kind of silly. And it looks like I’m the only one having the breakfast this morning! Geez, I could really use a shower man. And my hair washed.</p>

<p>It’s raining outside and I feel so lazy. Thinking about just catching a taxi to the hostel. Shouldn’t be more than $50? Have to book my bus back to Jhb today - oops, I forgot about the one back to Durbs… oh oh.</p>

<p>Just had breakfast with this really nice guy from Bulawayo. The Italian guy also pitched up - he’s a bit annoying though. I like Zimbabweans though, they’re super friendly - full of smiles.</p>

<p>Just listening to the news: big floods in Chimanimani and Beitbridge! Hope I can make it back, sounds serious - Cyclone Eline causing it all.</p>

<p>Well, the taxi cost me $71, but it was worth it, cause it’s pissing down. Those Danish girls and I assume the annoying Australian are staying here.It would suck if the asshole Australian and the asshole Englishman were both in the dorm here, what a fucking nightmare.</p>

<p>I think I’ll have to brave the rain after lunch. It’s kind of cold but if I wear my slops and my swimming trunks, at least they dry quickly.</p>

<p>Couldn’t get through to Colleen today - it’s raining so the phones don’t work. Hostel’s getting kind of full. Hope none of these guys snore!</p>

<p>Tired.</p>

<p>I had my second really scary experience today - one of those “Hello my friend” guys came up and I ignored him as I do sometimes and this guy grabbed my arm and wouldn’t let go and was getting really pissed. I managed to get free and he didn’t pursue me, but it was shit.</p>

<p>Didn’t know it was this bad, but did you know one in two Zimbabwean adults is HIV positive?</p>
