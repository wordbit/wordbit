    I&rsquo;ve been taking a long break from blogging, but have been swamped with other projects and personal stuff. But I thought I&rsquo;d take this opportunity for a cool retrospective trip through the interwebs. Now, you may know that Yahoo&rsquo;s Geocities is closing this October. Well, I&rsquo;ve managed to save my oldest website from imminent oblivion through the painstaking process of re-coding each html file, capturing all the other files through a Firefox plug-in, and giving it a new home on this server.

    So the economy is caught in a perpetual flush cycle and the government is crumbling under the pressure of imminent deficits. You&rsquo;re waiting for HR to ask you to stop by so they can talk about &ldquo;restructuring&rdquo;. You&rsquo;re wondering if you can even afford to drive to the mall this holiday season, let alone buy mounds of stuff there. Well, no worries. Here are some resources for thrifty Canadians with the most meagre of budgets, because let&rsquo;s face it - right now it&rsquo;s cool to be cheap.

    If you want to see how a movie fared with the critics before you shell out your hard-earned bucks, check out rotten tomatoes. This popular website has recently been redesigned and has now gone into beta testing.
The new design isn&rsquo;t bad, but then again, I didn&rsquo;t have a problem with the old one either. I guess they were trying to go with a more community-based, web 2.0 format. The layout is still a bit cluttered, but looks lighter.
