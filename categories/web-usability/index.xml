      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&#34;left&#34; style=&#34;border:20px solid white&#34; src=&#34;http://wordbit.com/images/jakob_nielsen.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jakob Nielson is a web usability consultant who believes that page loading times should determine how a website is designed. To improve the user experience, for example, he advocates against using large graphics or fancy flash animations (among other things) because most users don&amp;rsquo;t have broadband. His work is important because it focuses on the most efficient way for users to navigate the web and websites. Partly as a result of his teachings, website designers have moved away from bloated graphic-heavy websites to cleaner, more intuitive interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nielson left his job as an engineer at Sun Microsystems to become a consultant. He helps businesses maximize their ROI on web redesigns for usability. He has a large following in web design circles but has come under some criticism for rejecting aesthetics at the expense of perfecting the user interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A look at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.useit.com/&#34;&gt;his website&lt;/a&gt; will tell you a lot about his design aesthetic.&lt;/p&gt;
