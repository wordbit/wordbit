    Well folks, this Wordpress blog has officially reached its end. But all the content remains and all broken links have been fixed. And now for the good news. The blogging continues over at wordbit.com where I&rsquo;ve moved to the Tumblr platform. Thanks for reading!

    Just a reminder that you can read uncensored rants and view personal pictures on my private blog. To make it simple, I&rsquo;ve added a &ldquo;PRIVATE&rdquo; button to the top menu bar on this website in between &ldquo;CONTACT&rdquo; and &ldquo;RSS&rdquo;. If you know me, just email or facebook me and ask for the password. It&rsquo;s simple - if I even vaguely know who you are, then you&rsquo;re in. Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m not screening out people I don&rsquo;t like, lol!

    Another year is upon us and wordbit is in its 5th year! But with sporadic posts, this site has slowly slipped into oblivion. Well, I always have good intentions, but I have decided to create another personal blog, while keeping wordbit as the &ldquo;public face&rdquo; of my professional life. So, my personal blog is at antoineg.info, but you&rsquo;ll need to ask me for the password to access it. If I know you, you&rsquo;re in!

    I&rsquo;ve been taking a long break from blogging, but have been swamped with other projects and personal stuff. But I thought I&rsquo;d take this opportunity for a cool retrospective trip through the interwebs. Now, you may know that Yahoo&rsquo;s Geocities is closing this October. Well, I&rsquo;ve managed to save my oldest website from imminent oblivion through the painstaking process of re-coding each html file, capturing all the other files through a Firefox plug-in, and giving it a new home on this server.

    alive magazine is out, and this month I have a men&rsquo;s beauty article published called &ldquo;Are you man enough to moisturize?&rdquo; Click here to check it out. It&rsquo;s meant to be informative, but it&rsquo;s also a marketing piece because I mention a few products that potential retail customers might be interested in.
Also, I&rsquo;ve recently updated my ePortfolio, which I&rsquo;m going to recommend to all potential employers from now on. I&rsquo;ve been sending out links to the portfolio on this blog, but that page is becoming a bit unwieldy.

    </header>

    The May edition of alive magazine is out, and I have two articles published in it this month. A few months ago I interviewed stress guru Eli Bay about his relaxation techniques. Take a deep breath, relax for a few minutes and read his insights.
I also wrote a short piece on the rise of the mosquito population in our new era of rising temperatures. Mosquitoes love warm, moist climates, and they&rsquo;re getting a lot of that these days.

    I&rsquo;ve officially uploaded the latest version of my ePortolio - you can check it out here.
This website uses some flash elements and some fancy css coding and is basically geared towards technical writing employers as a way to showcase my work. I may expand it in the future to include other samples too.
For those who are interested, I designed it in Dreamweaver, Illustrator, and Photoshop. I used FlashSpring Pro 2 to convert a Powerpoint to flash.

    </header>

    Welcome to 2008! If you&rsquo;ve been here before then you&rsquo;ll notice that I&rsquo;ve finally put up a proper logo for the site. I&rsquo;m quite pleased with it, but it can always be tweaked. Other upgrades for the new year are taking place as you read this. I&rsquo;ve put up more writing samples, as well as simplified the design in my portfolio. Up next will be making an editing and design section.

    I&rsquo;m administering a new podcast for Rev. Craig Vance at my church. Craig&rsquo;s sermons are really insightful and quite intellectual. Anyway, the technical side of things has hardly been cutting edge as I&rsquo;ve been recording onto cassette tapes that get chewed up in my 1990 cassette player before they even get turned into an MP3. Nevertheless, I&rsquo;ve managed two so far and plan to keep that site updated every week. Check it out if you&rsquo;re interested.

      <h5 class="meta">Tue, Mar 6, 2007</h5>
    </header>

    Wordbit has been down for the count for a few days due to an experimental Google app I unwisely installed. So, just in case you were thinking of trying out one of the apps in Google Labs, think again.
Google Accelerator ostensibly speeds up your Internet browsing by diverting web pages through their servers. The problem is that the program pre-fetches all websites on any given page. This is fine for public browsing at, say, a library.

    According to the Wikia Wiki, a wordbit is &ldquo;the smallest deal that bears a meaning. Wordbits are the sound or sounds, sideput, that bear meaning.&rdquo;
Wordbits are the building blocks of language. This website is my small attempt to bring meaning to what we do as writers and hopefully contribute something to the writing &ldquo;blogosphere&rdquo;, if you&rsquo;ll excuse the jargon.
But this website is more than a blog. This is also a place where you can view my on-line portfolio, or check out some resources for other writers (still in progress).
