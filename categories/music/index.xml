      <description>Not all of Apple&amp;rsquo;s offerings are shiny and perfect. And when it comes to iTunes, most sane people will agree that this music player is just plain ugly. I applaud Scott Gilberson for calling it like it is in his blog post, &amp;ldquo;The Top Ten Reasons iTunes Sucks&amp;rdquo;. Here are his main beefs:
 It&amp;rsquo;s a store stupid
 The library manager is prehistoric
 No web browser/Wikipedia/anything
 No plug-in architecture</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re Homo Sapien then you&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard that song by Yael Na√Øm. Name not ringing any bells? You know, it&amp;rsquo;s the one that goes something like this: &amp;ldquo;La-la-la-la la-la-la-la-la&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; Still not getting it? Okay, it&amp;rsquo;s the song from the MacBook Air commercial. Yes, you know the one (and if you still have no clue, check out this YouTube video).
The song is called &amp;ldquo;New Soul&amp;rdquo; and was handpicked by Steve Jobs for the MacBook campaign.</description>
