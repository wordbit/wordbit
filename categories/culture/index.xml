      <title>Why I’ll pass on the iPad</title>
      <link>http://wordbit.com/posts/why-ill-pass-on-the-ipad/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://wordbit.com/images/ipad1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ipad&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were many naysayers when this “magical device” first came out. It’s nothing but a glorified iPod Touch they cried. No front-facing camera. No multitasking (until the Fall that is, when iPhone OS 4 comes out). No USB ports, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well I’m not one of those nitpicking technocrats. I think that the iPad is like a shiny piece of the future, straight out of Star Trek. It’s amazing. But here’s the thing: I don’t even own a laptop. Never have. I own a Desktop computer – gasp – built piece by piece from scratch in the dirty streets of the Yongsan electronics market in Seoul, South Korea. That was six years ago. I’m not exactly an early adopter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days, however, I’ve been thinking of switching to a laptop. Sadly I won’t be able to build it myself. But at least I’ll catch up to the crowd. Maybe ten years from now, iPads will be as ubiquitous as laptops are today. If so, I may think about picking one up for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Culture shock...at work</title>

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re more concerned with your company culture than the size of your pay cheque, your might be interested in this Vancouver start-up. &lt;a href=&#34;http://jiibe.com/&#34;&gt;Jiibe&lt;/a&gt; is a user-generated service that matches your value system to a compatible company based on a questionnaire you fill out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can see this site being really useful to young Millennials who care a great deal about the softer aspects of job satisfaction and are in a process of self-discovery. However, this sort of thing (&amp;ldquo;eHarmony for jobs&amp;rdquo; as one user put it) might be a bit touchy-feely for boomers. But hey, if you&amp;rsquo;re unemployed you probably have time to slog through the 100+ questions and spend some pleasant self-actualization time finding out you should have been working for Tim Hortons this whole time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Have a laugh, have a cry</title>
      <link>http://wordbit.com/posts/have-a-laugh-have-a-cry/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here are some recent article shorts. As usual, you can click on the thumbnails to read them. The one on the left is a feel-good piece on laughter yoga. The right piece touches on the depressing psychological and cultural effects of global warming. There&amp;rsquo;s also a teeny one in there on the dodgy air we have to breathe in airplanes (even Purell won&amp;rsquo;t save you this time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://wordbit.freehostia.com/scans/laughteryoga.html&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://wordbit.com/images/yoga192.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;yoga192&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordbit.freehostia.com/scans/greenlivingnov08.html&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://wordbit.com/images/green%20living193.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;green living193&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing these two articles juxtaposed like this evokes a stark contrast between Western frivolity and Aboriginal reality. Note how they&amp;rsquo;re both sitting in the same cross-legged position too. I almost wish the art department had actually planned it that way.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ultimate relaxation techniques</title>
      <link>http://wordbit.com/posts/ultimate-relaxation-techniques/</link>

&lt;p&gt;The May edition of &lt;em&gt;alive&lt;/em&gt; magazine is out, and I have two articles published in it this month. A few months ago I interviewed stress guru &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.elibay.com&#34;&gt;Eli Bay&lt;/a&gt; about his relaxation techniques. Take a deep breath, relax for a few minutes and &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordbit.freehostia.com/scans/EBayInterview.html&#34;&gt;read his insights&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&#34;left&#34; style=&#34;border:20px solid white&#34; src=&#34;http://wordbit.com/images/mosquito.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wrote a short piece on &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordbit.freehostia.com/scans/Mosquito%20article.html&#34;&gt;the rise of the mosquito population&lt;/a&gt; in our new era of rising temperatures. Mosquitoes love warm, moist climates, and they&amp;rsquo;re getting a lot of that these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of the rest of this week, I expect to be blogging exclusively on DocTrain West, which I&amp;rsquo;m attending this week.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Canada&#39;s most livable cities</title>
      <link>http://wordbit.com/posts/canadas-most-livable-cities/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2008 19:09:19 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://wordbit.com/posts/canadas-most-livable-cities/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&#34;left&#34; style=&#34;border:20px solid white&#34; src=&#34;http://wordbit.com/images/Ottawa.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canadian Business magazine has just released their annual report on &lt;a href=&#34;http://list.canadianbusiness.com/rankings/bestplacestolive/2008/prosperity/Default.aspx?sp2=1&amp;amp;d1=a&amp;amp;sc1=6&amp;amp;sub=n1&amp;amp;df=bestcities&#34;&gt;Canada&amp;rsquo;s best places to live&lt;/a&gt;. Our cold and sober capital, Ottawa, graced the number one spot based on factors like household income, unemployment rate, and new cars (New cars? Really? What does splashing out on some smoking wheels have to do with livability?). Vancouver shuffled in at number 10. And what impoverished, crappy-car-driving town came in last at number 154?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://wordbit.com/images/PtAlberni.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well that would be poor old Port Alberni. I saw an interview with the mayor on the local news this morning and he was livid. When asked why people should live in his city his answer was telling: &amp;ldquo;We have a new pulp mill&amp;hellip;oh, and my wife is one of the best cooks in BC.&amp;rdquo; This culinary reference a retort, no doubt, to the fact that all the magazine editor had to eat in Port Alberni was &amp;ldquo;a donut.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what city has the newest cars in Canada? That honour goes to a city in the Lower Mainland famous for its dodgy street racing and souped-up honda civics that tear up the parking lot at the SilverCity every Saturday night. You guessed it - Richmond.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Colour, culture, web design</title>
      <link>http://wordbit.com/posts/colour-culture-web-design/</link>

&lt;p&gt;The cultural differences in the perception of colour are well known to anthropologists. Red, for example is bold and signifies anger in the West, but is considered lucky in the East, especially in China. But do web designers take the cultural colour faux pas into consideration? They should. Especially if designing for international clients. After all, colour is a tricky beast and just because you happen to be in love with mauve, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean your client will. Even if your client doesn&amp;rsquo;t live across the planet, chances are they might not be that crazy about the latest trends in web design (more white space, anyone?).  The best thing you can do is create a colour scheme right off the bat, even before you dive into dreamweaver and blindly start clicking the colour palette. Once the client signs off on the colour scheme, you&amp;rsquo;re good to go.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Skid marks on your soul</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over at Wired&amp;rsquo;s video gallery you can watch some &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wired.com/gadgets/miscellaneous/multimedia/2008/01/gallery_vintage_ads&#34;&gt;amusing tech vintage commercials&lt;/a&gt;. While I find the ones for the old Mac, the Vic-20, and the Commodore chuckle worthy, my vote for the funniest - and the most creative - goes to the 1980s ad for the Atari 5200&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Pole Position&lt;/em&gt;. Back in those days, the marketing strategy was basically to show as little of the game&amp;rsquo;s graphics as possible while hyping up the game in various ridiculous ways. That made for some highly creative advertising. Check out this howler:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiEj4RNpYME&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://img.youtube.com/vi/kiEj4RNpYME/0.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t you love the cheesy model car that gets picked up by the &amp;ldquo;giant&amp;rdquo; hand?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can governments read people&amp;rsquo;s minds with radio waves? Many people believe so. In fact, in order to combat this unseen menace, a paranoid subculture has arisen around the wearing of tin foil hats. This seemingly bizarre practice has garnered such credibility that &lt;a href=&#34;http://people.csail.mit.edu/rahimi/helmet/&#34;&gt;an MIT student conducted empirical research&lt;/a&gt; in order to debunk it. Curiously, his findings indicated that tin foil in fact &lt;em&gt;amplifies&lt;/em&gt; certain radio frequencies. Ironically, or perhaps tellingly, the frequencies amplified are the very same governmental and corporate frequencies that paranoids are trying to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can&amp;rsquo;t get enough of tin foil technology, check out this &lt;a href=&#34;http://zapatopi.net/afdb/&#34;&gt;incredibly detailed website&lt;/a&gt;, which includes links to a book on amazon.com as well as &lt;a href=&#34;http://zapatopi.net/afdb/afdbdiagram.pdf&#34;&gt;PDF instructions&lt;/a&gt; on how to build your own aluminum foil deflector beanie.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cultural sensitivity in user documentation</title>
      <link>http://wordbit.com/posts/cultural-sensitivity-in-user-documentation/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 28 Feb 2007 09:24:51 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://wordbit.com/posts/cultural-sensitivity-in-user-documentation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/WindowsLiveWriter/Culturalsensitivityinuserdocumentation_AA6/angry%20leprechaun%5B4%5D.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt; When editing technical documents, how aware should you be of regional differences in pronunciation? Here is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.redhatmagazine.com/2007/02/26/how-to-write-really-good-documentationsemi-definite-rules-for-the-indefinite-article/&#34;&gt;an interesting article&lt;/a&gt; on the subject by Brian Forte. Forte raises the following issue regarding the usage of an indefinite article with initialisms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;How do you pronounce an initialism like HTML?

I was taught English in public Australian schools of the 1970s. So I was taught _aitch_ rather than _haitch._ Which means I pronounce ‘HTML’ with an initial vowel sound and I write ‘an HTML page.’

If I’d gone to a private Irish Catholic school, however, I would have been taught _haitch_ and would, naturally enough, think ‘a HTML page’ is correct.&lt;!-- more --&gt;

More generally, _haitch_ is standard in Hiberno-English and is a way for disputing Protestant and Catholic Northern Irelanders to distinguish themselves from each other.

So, if I insist on ‘an HTML page’ I’m telling 4.5 million English speakers their way of writing and speaking is wrong, or non-standard at the very least. And I can’t reveal accent by writing ‘an ’TML page’ because it’s a technical document, not a novel.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously though, how many Irish Catholics are going to tear up their Linux manuals in disgust after discovering a pernicious &amp;ldquo;an&amp;rdquo; embedded in the text? It&amp;rsquo;s nothing personal. Technical writers are just following a style guide. Some tech writers will go with &amp;ldquo;a html&amp;rdquo; because they look at the expanded form of the initialism. So &amp;ldquo;a Hypertext Markup Language Page&amp;rdquo; would be written as &amp;ldquo;a html&amp;rdquo;. Does that mean everybody who pronounces &amp;ldquo;h&amp;rdquo; as &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;aitch&amp;rdquo; (which is the majority of the English-speaking world) should label these writers as hate-mongering, prejudiced Irish Catholics?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all comes down to schisms in pronunciation. Yet, in today&amp;rsquo;s globalized world, there isn&amp;rsquo;t much room to argue with the majority.&lt;/p&gt;
