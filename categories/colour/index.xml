&lt;p&gt;The cultural differences in the perception of colour are well known to anthropologists. Red, for example is bold and signifies anger in the West, but is considered lucky in the East, especially in China. But do web designers take the cultural colour faux pas into consideration? They should. Especially if designing for international clients. After all, colour is a tricky beast and just because you happen to be in love with mauve, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean your client will. Even if your client doesn&amp;rsquo;t live across the planet, chances are they might not be that crazy about the latest trends in web design (more white space, anyone?).  The best thing you can do is create a colour scheme right off the bat, even before you dive into dreamweaver and blindly start clicking the colour palette. Once the client signs off on the colour scheme, you&amp;rsquo;re good to go.&lt;/p&gt;
