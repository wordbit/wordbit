      <description>Seems like an oxymoron, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it. Hasn&amp;rsquo;t everybody read Harry Potter? Does anybody who goes to a Harry Potter not know what&amp;rsquo;s going to happen the minute Potter raises his wand? Sadly, yes. For every thousand kids that read the book, there are probably tens of thousands more that find the Potter movies as fresh and entertaining as the Lord of the Rings, precisely because they never even read the books.</description>

      <description>This is a personal blog. Having read that sentence, you might be inclined to click away in disgust. I won&amp;rsquo;t blame you. In fact, I hope that is exactly what you do. I&amp;rsquo;m not really writing this stuff for your enjoyment - it&amp;rsquo;s more for mine. But, if you stick around, I won&amp;rsquo;t tell you to fuck off. I mean, it&amp;rsquo;s not like I&amp;rsquo;m some sort of misanthrope or something. I just want you to know that this could be mind-numbingly boring for you.</description>
