      <description>With the recent release of Firefox 3 Beta 5, the end is in sight for an official release of this popular browser (in the meantime, Internet Explorer 8 Beta 1 has just come out). Here are some of the improvements Firefox 3 has over it&amp;rsquo;s predecessor:

 Faster (better memory management). Two to four times faster than Firefox 2.
 Safer. Scans for malware and checks for phishing.
 More intuitive address bar (with autofill feature).</description>

      <title>Is Brijit liberating or enslaving?</title>

      <description>For those of you who aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar with it, Brijit is a website that publishes 100-word summaries of various web, TV, radio, and print media. The idea is that there is so much information out there - wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be nice if we had the short-short version so we can get the gist of it and decide if it&amp;rsquo;s worth reading or watching the whole thing.
It&amp;rsquo;s a neat idea, but with so much content out there, it would be impossible for an editorial team to cover it all.</description>
