    Come and support the grads of the Print Futures program at our portfolio show this Thursday from 4:30pm to 7:30pm. You can drop in or stay for the whole event.
There&rsquo;ll be free food, free music, and free conversation with some of the most talented writers this side of the Fraser River. The booze you&rsquo;ll have to pay for.

      <h5 class="meta">Tue, Apr 8, 2008</h5>
    </header>

    I won a ticket to this year&rsquo;s DocTrain West conference through the Westcoast STC! I&rsquo;d like to thank the organizer Scott Abel and the good people at the STC for giving me this terrific opportunity. As I mentioned before, if you can afford the $899, or have a generous employer, then be there or don&rsquo;t-be-square.

    </header>

    The content convergence and integration conference was a mind-blowing excursion into the wild terrains of content management. For those confused by the conference title, let me tell you the gist of it (from what I could gather).
We live in the information age, yet for the most part organizations fail to use content as a commodity and a valuable asset. As writers, we need to impress upon decision makers that the strategic use of content can indeed achieve the goals of the company, and is not a superfluous add-on.

    This conference kicked off in Vancouver today and is the place to be if you&rsquo;re facing content management issues in your professional life as a technical writer, or if you want to stay on the leading edge of developments in the field. Each day has a specific theme. Day 1 (today) is about content, day 2 about technology, and day 3 about user relationships. I&rsquo;ll be volunteering there the whole day tomorrow, and will tell you all about it later (if you&rsquo;re going, be sure to say hello).

    </header>

    On Friday I had the pleasure of attending the 27th Pearls book launch, the annual anthology of creative writing works by Douglas College students. My story, The Reluctant Teacher, was published in it this year. I&rsquo;ve had some poetry published in Pearls before, but that was about 8 years ago, so it&rsquo;s been a while. A few of the authors read by candlelight and I got to see a few familiar faces.

    </header>

    I&rsquo;m glad I was able to attend Northern Voice this year - it was informative and inspiring for the most part. All the clicking laptops around me were a bit daunting, but gave me something to aspire to.
The morning kicked off with the keynote address by Matt Mullenweg, founder of Wordpress (the excellent blogging platform on which this website is based). Listen to the audio here.
I then listened to a talk by the CEO of Broadband Mechanics, Marc Canter on bringing social to software.

    Whether you&rsquo;re a hardcore blogger or just thinking of starting one up, you can&rsquo;t miss Northern Voice, Vancouver&rsquo;s 4th blogging and social media conference. This event gets bigger and more popular every year, but is still &ldquo;cheap, friendly and open to all.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s only $40 for one day ($60 for both).
On a similar note, the second DocTrain West is coming to Vancouver in May and the topic is - gosh, what a shocker - Web 2.
