      <description>Just a reminder that you can read uncensored rants and view personal pictures on my private blog. To make it simple, I&amp;rsquo;ve added a &amp;ldquo;PRIVATE&amp;rdquo; button to the top menu bar on this website in between &amp;ldquo;CONTACT&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;RSS&amp;rdquo;. If you know me, just email or facebook me and ask for the password. It&amp;rsquo;s simple - if I even vaguely know who you are, then you&amp;rsquo;re in. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, I&amp;rsquo;m not screening out people I don&amp;rsquo;t like, lol!</description>

      <description>Another year is upon us and wordbit is in its 5th year! But with sporadic posts, this site has slowly slipped into oblivion. Well, I always have good intentions, but I have decided to create another personal blog, while keeping wordbit as the &amp;ldquo;public face&amp;rdquo; of my professional life. So, my personal blog is at antoineg.info, but you&amp;rsquo;ll need to ask me for the password to access it. If I know you, you&amp;rsquo;re in!</description>

      <title>Northern Voice a wrap</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m glad I was able to attend Northern Voice this year - it was informative and inspiring for the most part. All the clicking laptops around me were a bit daunting, but gave me something to aspire to.
The morning kicked off with the keynote address by Matt Mullenweg, founder of Wordpress (the excellent blogging platform on which this website is based). Listen to the audio here.
I then listened to a talk by the CEO of Broadband Mechanics, Marc Canter on bringing social to software.</description>

      <description>Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a hardcore blogger or just thinking of starting one up, you can&amp;rsquo;t miss Northern Voice, Vancouver&amp;rsquo;s 4th blogging and social media conference. This event gets bigger and more popular every year, but is still &amp;ldquo;cheap, friendly and open to all.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s only $40 for one day ($60 for both).
On a similar note, the second DocTrain West is coming to Vancouver in May and the topic is - gosh, what a shocker - Web 2.</description>
