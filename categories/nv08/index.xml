      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m glad I was able to attend Northern Voice this year - it was informative and inspiring for the most part. All the clicking laptops around me were a bit daunting, but gave me something to aspire to.
The morning kicked off with the keynote address by Matt Mullenweg, founder of Wordpress (the excellent blogging platform on which this website is based). Listen to the audio here.
I then listened to a talk by the CEO of Broadband Mechanics, Marc Canter on bringing social to software.</description>
