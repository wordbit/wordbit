# Antoine Giraud's Blog

Greetings netizen – thanks for stopping by. My name is Antoine and this is my personal blog. I’ve been blogging online since 2003 and am a writer by trade. Here you’ll find longform posts covering a variety of topics that interest me. This blog is pretty simple and you won’t find anything except pure unadulterated content here; however, you’re welcome to talk to me about anything I’ve written about on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wordbit). In case you were wondering, I try to post at least once a month. Thanks again for reading and welcome to my home on the Internet.
