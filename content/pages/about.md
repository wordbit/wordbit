# Stuart Rackham's Blog

My name is Stuart and I've been programming computers professionally since the early Eighties.

This blog site is built by [Hugo](http://hugo.spf13.com) and is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/srackham/stuarts-notes).

The look and feel is based on a theme [adapted by Spencer Lyons](https://github.com/spencerlyon2/hugo_gh_blog) from [Jekyll's Lanyon theme](http://lanyon.getpoole.com). More details in my [Porting my blog to Hugo](/posts/porting-my-blog-to-hugo/) blog post.

I [ported this blog from WordPress](/posts/porting-my-blog-with-hugo) at the beginning of 2015, my old blog site can [be found here](http://srackham.wordpress.com/).

I update my posts to fix errors; refine content; add additional content; delete outdated content or make changes because I've change my mind. I do not document the changes in the posts -- you can see the changes I've made by looking at the [Github repository](https://github.com/srackham/stuarts-notes).
