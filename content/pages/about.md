# About

Hello – thanks for stopping by! My name is Antoine and this is my personal site. I’ve been publishing online since 2003 when I started blogging on LiveJournal. Here you’ll find longform posts covering a variety of topics that interest me.

This site is pretty simple and you won’t find anything except pure unadulterated words here. There is no comments section; however, you’re welcome to talk to me about anything I’ve written about on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wordbit) or <a rel="me" href="https://wandering.shop/@wordbit">Mastodon</a>.

This is an old-school web log. I don't track metrics and I don't make any money on this site. I only write for the love of it. My promise to you, dear reader, is that I post at least once a month. Thanks again for visiting my home on the Internet.
