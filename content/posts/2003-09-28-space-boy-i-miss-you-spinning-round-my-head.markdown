I think I've been day dreaming the whole week-end, I'm not sure where the time goes anymore. Friday night, went out to dinner with Sulu, had a few drinks in a mexican bar, shot some pool. Remembered why I never shoot pool. Went home. Been thinking alot, about art and pain, about people and our society, about the future. Just been for a night-time stroll, there was an orchestra playing a symphony in the parking lot of the city hall. Went for a walk in the nearby woods and it felt like I had my own personal soundtrack to my wandering life. It was wierd, the air was cool but there were distinct pockets of warm air that I'd walk through like giant heat bubbles.
