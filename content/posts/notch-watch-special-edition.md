I've been obsessing over the iPhone's notch [since 2017]({{< relref "2017-11-16-iphone-x.markdown" >}}). I pen an ongoing segment here called _Notch Watch_ and even created a dedicated [Notch Watch website](https://notchwatch.carrd.co/).

But I've reached a turning point - an editorial dilemma if you will - as the notch's days are surely numbered. All my complaining over the "dreaded notch" will soon have to... evolve.

At Apple's annual September event, Apple introduced the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, which still have notches. They also still have everything the iPhone 13 had last year, including the old A15 chip. We'll chat more about this later.

But with the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max, Apple tried really, really hard to change the notch narrative. And you know what? They might have done it.

Instead of a notch, the Face ID sensors and selfie camera have been moved into a pill-shaped cut-out that only Apple could get away with calling the "Dynamic Island".

Yes, there is nobody else on this planet who could take this bombastic name seriously. Joanna Stern at the Wall Street Journal hilariously rowed out to a literal island in a canoe for [her iPhone 14 Pro review](https://youtu.be/E88hraQR6PY) - amazing. The tech press have even started calling the old notch the "Static Peninsula" with tongue firmly in cheek.

But goofy name aside, the Dynamic Island - sorry, I just can't - the pill cut-out is now far more than it appears to be.

I love it and I hate it.
