I've been obsessing over the iPhone's notch [since 2017]({{< relref "2017-11-16-iphone-x.markdown" >}}). Not only do I pen an ongoing segment here called _Notch Watch_, but I even created a dedicated [Notch Watch website](https://notchwatch.carrd.co/).

However, I've reached a turning point - an editorial dilemma if you will - as the notch's days are surely numbered. All my complaining over the "dreaded notch" will soon have to... evolve.

At Apple's annual September event, Apple introduced the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. These do still have notches. They also still have everything the iPhone 13 had last year, including the old A15 chip. We'll chat more about this later.

But with the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max, Apple tried really, really hard to change the notch narrative. And you know what? They might have done it.

Instead of a notch, the Face ID sensors and selfie camera have been moved into a pill-shaped cut-out that only Apple could get away with calling the "Dynamic Island".

Yes, there is nobody else on this planet who could take this bombastic name seriously. As a case in point, Joanna Stern at the Wall Street Journal hilariously rowed out to a literal island in a canoe for [her iPhone 14 Pro review](https://youtu.be/E88hraQR6PY). Amazing. The tech press have even started calling the old notch the "Static Peninsula" - with tongue firmly in cheek.

But goofy name aside, the Dynamic Island - sorry, I just can't - the pill cut-out (henceforth called "the island") is now far more than it appears to be.

The island is essentially a software UI on top of the cut-out that effectively displays status notifications with some really cool, fluid animations - if you're not familiar with the island yet, [watch the promo video](https://youtu.be/WuEH265pUy4) and you'll quickly get the idea.

Instead of determinedly ignoring the unsightly blemish, Apple is flipping the script and forcing you to look at it all the time. By leaning into it and making it fun and interactive, Apple is trying to trick us into loving it. Ah yes, the old validation feedback loop - it's classic psychological conditioning.

It's a good idea. No, it's a really great idea, but I hate it. While the notch started out as a design compromise, it has now evolved into an elaborate ruse. Visually - I can't believe I'm saying this - the notch is actually nicer. It doesn't cut into the height of the screen as much as the island does. And it doesn't leave that tiny sliver of useless display floating above it. The island also looks objectively worse when viewing video in landscape mode.

But perhaps the most frustrating aspect of the island is its longevity. Firstly, its arrival indicates that a true full-screen iPhone is many, many years away, which is just sad. Apple wouldn't pour all this work into a feature that will go away next year.

Secondly, when the full-screen dream iPhone does arrive, say four years from now, will the now-beloved island just vanish as if it were never there, like an episode of _Lost_? After tricking people into falling in love with it, would Apple really yank away their precious plaything?

My personal take is that the island will stick around in some capacity - even on a full-screen iPhone. Perhaps it will momentarily disappear when watching video. Or it will evolve further, becoming less of an island and more of a fluid notification area in the top of the display. The status icons and animations could stay, but the black pill shape would no longer be necessary.
