My co-worker came across a user manual that showed a smiley face on the final page. We thought it was a gutsy move and one we could never get away with. However, while it's not advisable to inject humour or memes into user manuals, I thought it would be great if one of our manuals ended with this:

Maybe manuals would do a better job at capturing the attention of the younger generation, no?
