This topic interests me because I lived for a year in South Korea in a little town close to the border. I went up to the border on more than one occasion and even have a piece of the barbed wire fence dividing North and South Korea. I'm waiting for re-unification. That piece of wire could be as momentous as having a piece of the Berlin wall. Anyway, if you have a minute to spare, [check out this hilarious example of North Korean propaganda](http://video.google.ca/videoplay?docid=3813036076281028527&q=kim+jong+il). In North Korea, legend has it that Kim Jong Il was born on top of a sacred mountain. The clouds opened up, and he came down from heaven...

 

In reality, Kim Jong Il was born in a Russian military camp. I should point out that the above video would be taken quite seriously in North Korea. If you have more time, then be sure to watch [this fascinating documentary on Kim Jong Il and the Nuclear arms conflict](http://video.google.ca/videoplay?docid=3787046457101273554&q=north+korea). What I found especially fascinating is the way he infuses spiritual determinism into his political platform. He has set himself up as a sort of deity who is a father figure to the North Korean people. This representation is entirely congruent with Confucian ideology on hierarchical family structures where the nation is equal to a family and the father must always be obeyed.

 

Kim Jong Il started out in the communist party making propaganda movies and musicals and was said to have a lot of "girlfriends" in the industry. It's incredible that there are still dictators like this in the world.
