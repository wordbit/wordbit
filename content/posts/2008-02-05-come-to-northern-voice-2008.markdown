[![Banner](http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/Banner2.png)](http://2008.northernvoice.ca/) Whether you're a hardcore blogger or just thinking of starting one up, you can't miss [Northern Voice](http://2008.northernvoice.ca/), Vancouver's 4th blogging and social media conference. This event gets bigger and more popular every year, but is still "cheap, friendly and open to all." It's only $40 for one day ($60 for both).

On a similar note, the second [DocTrain West](http://www.doctrain.com/west/) is coming to Vancouver in May and the topic is - gosh, what a shocker - Web 2.0 and it's impact on communication. If you have $999 to spare, or maybe a generous employer, then do attend - it's the _crème de la crème_ of conferences for technical communicators.
