Spurred on by the recession, a number of tech-savvy people have started blogging on various "new school" ways of getting a job. Tech evangelist Robert Scoble has [some crafty tips](http://scobleizer.com/2009/01/12/if-you-are-laid-off-heres-how-to-socially-network/). I tend to agree with him when he says your blog is your résumé. After all, google my name and this blog is the first search result (and if you are a hiring manager, then please note my correct formatting of the word _résumé_!). 

Local writer and social media consultant Monica Hamburg talks about how to tap into the hidden job market online in [her excellent blog post](http://monicahamburg.wordpress.com/2009/01/13/job-search-new-school/).
