Today we watched a compelling drama based on the true story of Stephen Glass. This 25 year old rising star of _New Republic_ magazine, the in flight mag of Air Force 1, was caught fabricating the vast majority of his pieces. He would go so far as to make up fake voice mails, notes and even a website to corroborate his lies. It’s a great movie called [Shattered Glass](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shattered_glass/). After watching the movie, our prof asked us to find Glass’s articles on Academic Search Premier. They were still available, without any mention of them being completely made up.

Unbelievably, Glass signed a major book deal about his experience and hopes to become a practicing lawyer in New York.
