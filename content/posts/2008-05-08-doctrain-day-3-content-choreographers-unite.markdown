DocTrain chugged along today and picked up some speed with a heavy emphasis on social media. As with yesterday's post, I'll give you the skinny and the slides on each presentation as well my pick for 'what's hot'. 

Great people, good food, and leading-edge content. Kudos to the organizers and to the Marriott Pinnacle for hosting this terrific event. And a huge thanks also to the Westcoast STC for the opportunity to attend.

Here's the best of the rest:

_B. Noz Urbina_ (Mekon)

In the closing keynote, Urbina gave practical advice on how to create documents more efficiently and save your company money (the reason companies pay for employees to fly to these conferences in the first place).
