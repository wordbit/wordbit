What more could you ask for from Apple's WWDC than a plethora of Craig Federighi (aka Hair Force One) memes? From Craig's hair blowing in the wind to Craig in a garish tracksuit - we got it all.

Apple's video production team proves once again that online video presentations are more fun for Apple fans who could never afford to attend in person.

Although Apple did invite a group of both developers and journalists to attend, it was only to watch the video presentation outside while getting painfully toasted in the Californian sun. Not really worth the expense, in my opinion, even if you got to eat croissants in the Apple Park caf√©.

Who knows what next year will bring. But, for now, I'm enjoying the cheeky transitions and faster pace of a pre-recorded show.

As is tradition around here, here are my personal thoughts and impressions of what went down. For a full detailed rundown, head over to your favourite tech journalism site.

WWDC is a software extravaganza (this year, however, there was a hardware surprise) and is always more frivolous than the serious hardware announcements in September.

Let's start with **iOS 16**.

Hands down, the best new feature announced was the redesigned lock screen. Not only is the layout improved, with new notifications appearing at the bottom, but you can now pick and choose fonts, photo filters, widgets to create what is essentially your own magazine cover page.

The depth effects are impressive, with text appearing in a layer behind images with a masking effect. Apparently the depth effects aren't exclusive to Portrait photos either. I can't wait to try it out.

Other upcoming features include focus filters, the ability to edit and un-send messages, improved dictation (you can type and talk simultaneously), and this cool photos trick where you can remove a subject from a background with one touch.

**WatchOS 9** brings a few new watch faces -alright, alright, alright. And there are a lot more metrics for runners, including heart-rate zones and interval training. The sleep app will show you sleep stages, such as REM and deep sleep.

The best new watchOS 9 feature? Medication tracking, including drug interaction alerts. If I make it to my 90s, you bet I'll be wearing an Apple Watch. Assuming, of course, that old me can afford one.

For present-day me, though, it's great to see ongoing improvements to my Series 6.

The marquis feature on **iPadOS 16** was a multitasking paradigm called Stage Manager. Featuring a sidebar of open apps, this feature really shines when you attach a keyboard, a mouse, and an external display. The external monitor becomes an additional display (not just a mirrored display as is the case now) with bona-fide resizable windows.

Oh, and the weather app finally makes its way to the iPad!

On MacBooks and iMacs, **macOS Ventura** also brings Stage Manager, along with the usual improvements to staple apps like Spotlight, Mail, and Safari.

Perhaps the best (and worse) feature of macOS Ventura is the ability to mount your iPhone on the top of your display to use it was a webcam.

Apple **CarPlay** gets the award for the most surprising update - a full-on invasion of the car's entire instrument cluster. Assuming that your new car only uses displays for its instrument cluster - and I actually don't know of any. Come to think of it, this announcement is either vaporware or has something to do with the rumoured Apple Car project. [But just look at it](https://youtu.be/q5D55G7Ejs8?t=2332) - it's glorious.

Finally, that leaves Apple's **tvOS**... except there were no updates announced for tvOS. I think it's safe to say that the overpriced Apple TV hardware will continue down the road of redundancy to the destination of irrelevancy.

After the dust settled on the fast-and-furious eye candy of the keynote, everybody started digging into the details and the disgruntled mumbling began.

First in line with a legitimate grievance

* iPhone 7 gets shafted - refer back to my piece on iPhone XS
* Stage Manager for M1 iPads only
* My 2015 MacBook doesn't make the grade
* Some iOS features are iPhone 12 only I believe - have to check
* No AR announcements, which is the next big thing.

Had no idea that this was a thing, but it's fantastic:
