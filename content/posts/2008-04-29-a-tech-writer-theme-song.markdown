Every profession needs a theme song, right? Here's one I found about technical writing, unashamedly cannibalized from the _Beatles_ song "Paperback Writer."

This little ditty isn't exactly inspiring with lyrics like these: "So I spend my day inside a lonely pod, but I need a job, so I gotta be a technical writer." But hey, it's worth a laugh anyway.
