Electrical wires wrapped around my gums  
sustain the humming current in my frozen jaw  
Lest words ruin the thrumming bore  
I refrainÂ from peeling away my stuck tongue.




Just one more day bleeding through stick fingers  
into that cavernous library of blank-paged books.  
An agonizing chess move where the rooks  
checkmate endless kings in a game that lingers




far too long.
