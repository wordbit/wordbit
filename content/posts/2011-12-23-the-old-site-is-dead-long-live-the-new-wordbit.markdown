Visitors to wordbit.com may be surprised to see that everything has changed. I decided it was time. The days of traditional personal blogging have long since waned for several reasons:




  1. The rise of social networking and micro-blogging.


  2. The tenacity of spammers who bypass all known spam-blocking plug-ins.


  3. The ghost town of most blogs that don't have a cross-platform community.


  4. The dominance of corporate-run blogs where bloggers are paid to post something earth-shaking every hour.



With all these pressures, and the fact that I couldn't update my 2.0.9 Wordpress installation without breaking it's back, I decided to move to where all the cool kids hang - Tumblr. Feel free to join and follow, or don't. Either way, wordbit will continue to evolve and I will continue to write. That is all. Carry on.




PS. If you know me in person, ask me for the password to my [Private blog](http://wordbit.posterous.com). If you want to hire a writer, go to my [online portfolio](http://vancouverwriter.ca). If you miss the old site, I've kept it around on my [About](http://wordbit.tumblr.com/about) page. All the content is still there, but it'll take me a while to patch up all the broken links.
