I saw Terminator 3 today, it sucked except I have to agree with somebody who said that you have to be amazed at how Arnold has maintained such a great physique at his age. The internet server at work has been unplugged or is down or something so that lengthy update I promised my audience (of perhaps one or two people, sorry guys) will have to wait. I'm just hanging out at the PC bang and I have to participate in some cyber-ass-kicking right now so I get a good bang for my buck. But yes, I'm on vacation for a whole week and I'm loving it.
