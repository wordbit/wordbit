I didn't go anywhere really, but I feel like I'm at home in my mind, body and soul, so I've decided to start writing a poem once a week just for fun. These days I don't have too much to say about my existence as a _sunsangnim_, I feel like I've said it all before, and nobody reads this anymore because now I'm just an ordinary person lost in a plethora of other ordinary people's narratives in cyberspace. Anyway, back to the poem. It's easier sticking it up here than on [my (tantalizing and informative!!! See it now!!!)webpage](http://www.geocities.com/antoinehenrigiraud/). I've also stuck it up on [poems](http://www.livejournal.com/community/poems/). Here's the first one:

           Wildfireflower

         Conflict licked wick
       Woebegone missing gene
        Silicone cinder bits
  Miocene dentist ventriloquists
  Dance with the wind genie lean
      Into the prayer wheel
    Steal your soul-words from
   Your whispering god so humble
     Jumbled yet joyless like
  A tin-knuckled kinetic skeleton

The formatting is a bit off, but there you go...

Don't bother trying to interpret it, it's supposed to be a joy to articulate as well as conjuring up some interesting imagery. On the menu we have banal imagery juxtaposed with pseudo-sublime imagery in a cacophony of lexical paradoxes. 

Until next time
see ya
