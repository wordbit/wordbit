This phrase now resonates with new meaning after watching tonight’s performance of Verdi’s _Macbeth_ at the Vancouver opera. There’s nothing like the tortured soul of Macbeth as he struts about the stage moaning in Italian and secretly wishing he’d never married Lady Macbeth. Seriously though, this was a solid opera, even although _Carmen _is still my favourite, it was my first time seeing an operatic adaptation of Shakespeare. I quite enjoyed it. One of our classmates was Witch No. 3. I didn’t recognize him in tights though.

Here’s the promotional poster, but who these people are is a mystery, because they weren’t in the show. I don’t think the actual actors are as photogenic as these sombre folks.
