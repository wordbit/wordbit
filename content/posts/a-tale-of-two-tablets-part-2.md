And so concludes a tale of two tablets. The stage has been set. We have a face-off between the 10th generation iPad and the iPad Air 5. The winner will be my birthday present.

Plot twist - I already made my choice a while ago, long before October's iPad event.

In the run-up to the event, all the tech YouTubers and journalists kept spouting the same conventional wisdom: Hold off on buying an iPad until Apple reveals their new goodies. And under normal circumstances, this is great advice. You would be an utter fool, for example, if you bought a new iPhone in August.

While I'm no analyst, I've become pretty good at taking an educated gamble.

NOTES FOR PART 2:
