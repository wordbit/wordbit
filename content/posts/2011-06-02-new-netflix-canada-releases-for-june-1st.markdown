I love Netflix, but it's hard to tell when new movies come out and whether they're any good or not. So, here are the latest releases for June 1st and their Rotten Tomatoes / Flixster rating. I'll also be giving my top pick for the day for a movie I think is the number one worth watching out of the batch... And my top pick today is _Knight and Day_. Even though other movies got higher ratings, this looks like a fun action movie for the summer.
