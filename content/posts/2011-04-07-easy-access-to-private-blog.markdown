Just a reminder that you can read uncensored rants and view personal pictures on my private blog. To make it simple, I've added a "PRIVATE" button to the top menu bar on this website in between "CONTACT" and "RSS". If you know me, just email or facebook me and ask for the password. It's simple - if I even vaguely know who you are, then you're in. Don't worry, I'm not screening out people I don't like, lol! Otherwise, I will still cross-post geeky stuff right here on wordbit. Thanks for reading amigos.
