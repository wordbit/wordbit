There's normally nothing tech-related to write about in February and this month is no exception. And this February in particular, there really is nothing fun to write about.

I could get into all sorts of controversial topics, but that's not what we do here. If you're a future historian combing old web archives, just look February 2022 up and you'll have more than enough to write ten research papers. You've got everything from trucker protests to Russia invading Ukraine.

On a personal note, I was out of commission for a while earlier this month with COVID. Getting "the rona" was an inevitable development, but I made it through more-or-less intact, which is about the best outcome one could hope for. And the latest Omicron variant turned out to be more like a bad flu than the more aggressive variants that came before.

So, anyway, I promised some advice before I sign off.

Look, I know it's hard to be positive. We were all hoping for a great start to 2022, but instead got this:

(Yes, I know I said I'd stay away from politics, but we'll see how well this Russian war selfie ages.)

But, there's plenty of time in 2022 to turn things around, even if the only sphere of influence you have is in your personal life.

### Avoid these to improve your life

If you're looking for a healthier, happier year, my unsolicited advice is to avoid the following, and you'll do okay:

* The 1988 movie _Beaches_ starring Bette Midler. Billed as a comedy, instead this flick will have you sobbing by the end. Not funny at all. Fortunately, I managed to avoid watching this 80s movie until now. Unfortunately, I discovered that _Beaches_ is the origin point of the overplayed Bette Midler song _Wind Beneath My Wings_, which nobody alive in the 80s managed to avoid.
* The Hugo and Nebula award-winning novel _Ancillary Justice_ by Ann Leckie.
