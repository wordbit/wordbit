Taut naked limbs stretched but unlike saplings,




lacking musicality - more like organic hooks.




Poised over a midnight pool,




like a frozen breath nobody took.





Should I release this tension? Or will my supine ligaments snap,




tumbling me into the tepid waters where the drowned god waits




for a voice. Is it even a choice




I wonder to write of this -




to agonize over the spring.
