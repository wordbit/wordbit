So, you've done all your Christmas shopping, and maybe scored a few deals by reading my last blog post. Now you want to have some fun in the snow but the rocky economic climate is scaring you off the slopes. Continuing on the theme of thrifty spending, check out [my latest article](http://www.alive.com/lifestyle/cheap-winter-thrills/) on finding deals on winter sports equipment (while being eco-savvy at the same time). 

I enjoyed writing this article because, well, I'm a SME when it comes to being cheap. Let's just say that being a student has taught me how to stretch every dollar. And my hefty student loans will ensure the continuation of my pauper-like existence for some time to come!
