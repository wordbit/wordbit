So there we were - violently donkey kicking the flat tire in turns like a gang of crazed soccer hooligans. Rust, dirt, and malice had fused the tire rim onto the wheel hub and it wasn't coming off.

We were in Port Renfrew. If you don't know Port Renfrew then let me explain: with two restaurants and about a hundred residents, there isn't much else to it. True to its name - there is a port. But certainly no auto repair shops. And most tragically, no cell service or internet.

We had no other option than to kick that tire off.

Then, humanity came through. One after another, people stopped to help. One guy bent his piece of rebar trying to pry it off. Another shirtless, barefoot guy borrowed my shoes and taught us the donkey-kicking technique. Another suggested we lower the tire back down with the jack to loosen it with the car's weight. Another clean-cut young man used his satellite internet to look up the problem.

Incredibly, they kept on coming. And each one contributed to cracking that bad boy off, taking a turn to kick when we were too tired to kick anymore. Eventually a grizzled Hulk-Hogan guy took a piece of wood and a rock and hammered that tire off like Thor swinging Mj√∂lnir.

It was glorious, heart-warming, and a fitting end to the summer.

I'm not going to lie - I'm looking forward to August and everything after (I'm partial to stealing Counting Crows song titles, and now I'm stealing their best album title). I've made the most of summer, but fall is the best.

Bring on the hot coffee, hoodies, and new phones.
