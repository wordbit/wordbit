My [recent article](http://www.alive.com/lifestyle/no-rest-for-the-dead-battery/) on Battery Recycling is now available in the November issue of _alive_. I wasn’t aware of this before researching this topic, but you can recycle both single-use and rechargeable batteries in British Columbia.

Personally, I’m a big fan of [eneloop batteries](http://www.eneloop.info/). I believe the batteries Apple uses in their wireless mouse and keyboard are re-branded eneloops.
