As you may or may not recall, last August [my article on the evils of recycling](http://wordbit.freehostia.com/recycling-global-warming-and-toxic-toys/) was published. Sometimes I lose sight of the fact that thousands of people read the stuff I put out there. Some probably think it's a load of tosh. Other slightly more creepy individuals google my name and usually ask some sort of favour. But [others actually have something interesting to say](http://wordbit.freehostia.com/scans/letter.html). So Ben, even though you'll never read this, thanks for your letter. It's not often I get to hear from the mythical 'audience' writers always harp on about.
