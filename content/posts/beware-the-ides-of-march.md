Itâ€™s the great AI oil rush and the finite resource is all our digital data. But will anybody bother to learn how to write and keep generating new data? What happens when we run out? Will the AI become recursive, eventually cannibalizing itself. Or will it evolve?

I'm beginning to feel increasingly uneasy at the rapid pace of AI development, while at the same time finding it incredible useful.

* Maybe open with the banks collapsing and other such "ides"? But AI is more significant and important
* Talk about the rapid pace of development - Refer to
* Talk about your "toot" - Microsoft vs Apple
* Set the record straight on "What is a wordbit, anyway?" by chatgpt
* The introduction of ChatGPT4 and Microsoft's recent moves in the space...

Some links to explore and expand:

The detractors:

The false promise of chatgpt by Noam Chomsky:

Can't actually read this because its behind a paywall - but try

The stupidity of AI:

The idea that AI will lessen our workload and give us more free time:

The phenomenon of bullshit jobs:

Will AI create more BS, or will we actually work less?

There is still momentum for the four-day work week, but they are missing the point by squeezing 40 hours into four days:

Where are we now?

* maybe mention that when audio and visual AI hits, we're going to see more censorship (making James Bond woke for example -real thing). More "fake news" but also customized movies and songs - "create a new humphrey bogart movie"
