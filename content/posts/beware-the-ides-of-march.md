The great AI gold rush has begun.

Given the constant hype, it's tempting to dismiss the constant flow of Twitter posts on "Ten ChatGPT prompts that will blow your mind ðŸ¤¯", the thousands of shoddy AI start-ups flooding the app store, and the usual assortment of blustering, opportunistic idiots who have scratched "AR" or "NFTs" out of their bios to replace it with "AI all the time, every time".

But, there are concrete products, not just more vapourware, emerging out of the hype.

Microsoft, for example, is aggressively embedding AI into all their core Office products with a supercharged successor to Clippy they call "Co-Pilot". They promise to eliminate the drudgery of office work. They're probably not wrong (although they may also eliminate working-class, admin-focused office worker jobs at the same time).

Numerous other high-profile companies, from [Duolingo](https://blog.duolingo.com/duolingo-max/) to [Expedia](https://mashable.com/article/expedia-kayak-openai-chatgpt-plugins), are integrating ChatGPT plugins into their products, bringing AI to the mainstream.

In a rare display of enthusiasm, even Bill Gates has declared that "[The Age of AI has begun](https://www.gatesnotes.com/The-Age-of-AI-Has-Begun)", the title of his latest blog post. But, when discussing the risks and problems with AI, he says this:

> Then thereâ€™s the possibility that AIs will run out of control. Could a machine decide that humans are a threat, conclude that its interests are different from ours, or simply stop caring about us? Possibly, but this problem is no more urgent today than it was before the AI developments of the past few months.

Wait, what?

Shouldn't this "problem" be a whole lot more urgent today? When Bill Gates declares that the Age of AI has begun, he isn't being hyperbolic or bombastic. I believe he is right - the world is about to get crazy. But, given the rapid, exponential pace of AI development, is he right to dismiss the threat of AI malevolence so casually?

To be sure, there are a lot of intelligent people out there who are downplaying the hype. Currently, all the AI bots out there have a tendency to "hallucinate" and present made-up nonsense as facts. There is a sense that we're being duped by the oldest parlour trick in the book of snake-oil salesmen, a trick that amounts to no more than smoke and mirrors.

Neil Gaiman [rightly points out](https://twitter.com/neilhimself/status/1639610373115375616?cxt=HHwWgMCzudC8iMEtAAAA) that "ChatGPT doesn't give you information. It gives you information-shaped sentences."

The Guardian, not mincing words, published an article entitled "[The stupidity of AI](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/16/the-stupidity-of-ai-artificial-intelligence-dall-e-chatgpt)", in which they warn against the notion that these bots are actually intelligent when they are simply based on the "wholesale appropriation of existing culture". This warning does beg the question: When all human "content creators" are phased out in favour of generative AI, what happens when no more original human data is being created?

Will AI become recursive, cannibalizing itself, or will it learn to evolve beyond the constraints of its training data? Will anybody bother to learn how to write well anymore? It seems obvious to all that the days of formulaic writing are over, perhaps only the best of us will continue to pursue writing as an art form.

Eminent Anthropologist Noam Chomsky, who at 94 years old is still as sharp as barbed wire, wrote a piece for the New York Times entitled "[The False Promise of ChatGPT](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/08/opinion/noam-chomsky-chatgpt-ai.html)". In his piece, he dismays at the time and attention we're giving to something that is no more than a pale imitation of the incredible human mind. He says:

> The human mind is not, like ChatGPT and its ilk, a lumbering statistical engine for pattern matching, gorging on hundreds of terabytes of data and extrapolating the most likely conversational response or most probable answer to a scientific question. On the contrary, the human mind is a surprisingly efficient and even elegant system that operates with small amounts of information; it seeks not to infer brute correlations among data points but to create explanations.

Well, when you put it that way... it does seem silly to make all this fuss over something that doesn't even have a soul.

But, what will happen when, instead of asking an AI to parse the entire internet, where it is all but impossible to sort out fact from fiction, we give it a corporeal presence? I'd be far more wary of a self-learning superintelligence housed in an autonomous body of sorts, with the senses of sight, touch, and hearing provided by enhanced, network-connected sensors.

Has anyone at OpenAI given Boston Dynamics a call? I wouldn't be surprised. Brace yourselves.

Thankfully, we aren't quite there yet, although, that reality may be coming sooner than we think. For now, the question all white-collar workers are mulling over is this: Will AI give us more free time to pursue creative pursuits, or simply increase the lineups at the EI office?

The idea of AI freeing us so that we can work less is an old one.

Hitting close to home, I've already seen a Technical Writer job posting asking for experience "leveraging AI to expedite your editing/content writing with tools such as ChatGPT".

Yikes. After reading this, I scrambled to ask Bing AI (which uses ChatGPT 4) to edit a few paragraphs that I had recently edited. Comparing our two edits, it was clear that mine was far superior. Phew! My job is safe... for now.

But we need to talk more about the promises and threats looming over white-collar work - will AI give us more free time to pursue creative pursuits, or simply increase the lineups at the EI office?

Itâ€™s the great AI oil rush and the finite resource is all our digital data. But will anybody bother to learn how to write and keep generating new data? What happens when we run out? Will the AI become recursive, eventually cannibalizing itself. Or will it evolve?

I'm beginning to feel increasingly uneasy at the rapid pace of AI development, while at the same time finding it incredible useful.

Will AI create more BS, or will we actually work less?

There is still momentum for the four-day work week, but they are missing the point by squeezing 40 hours into four days:
