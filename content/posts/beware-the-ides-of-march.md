The great AI gold rush has begun.

Given the hype, it's tempting to dismiss the constant flow of Twitter posts on "Ten ChatGPT prompts that will blow your mind ðŸ¤¯", the thousands of shoddy AI start-ups flooding the app store, and the usual assortment of blustering trend-chasing idiots who have scratched "AR" or "NFTs" out of their bios to replace it with "AI all the time, every time".

But, there are concrete products emerging out of the hype that are undeniable game changers.

Microsoft, for example, is aggressively embedding AI into all their core Office products with a supercharged successor to Clippy they call "Co-Pilot". They promise to eliminate the drudgery of office work. They're not wrong - although they may also eliminate office worker jobs at the same time.

Hitting close to home, I've already seen a Technical Writer job posting asking for experience "leveraging AI to expedite your editing/content writing with tools such as ChatGPT".

Yikes. After reading this, I scrambled to ask Bing AI (which uses ChatGPT 4) to edit a few paragraphs that I had recently edited. Comparing our two edits, it was clear that mine was far superior. Phew! My job is safe... for now.

But we need to talk more about the promises and threats looming over white-collar work - will AI give us more free time to pursue creative pursuits, or simply increase the lineups at the EI office?

In his [recent blog post](https://www.gatesnotes.com/The-Age-of-AI-Has-Begun), entitled "The Age of AI has begun", Bill Gates has this to say:

> Then thereâ€™s the possibility that AIs will run out of control. Could a machine decide that humans are a threat, conclude that its interests are different from ours, or simply stop caring about us? Possibly, but this problem is no more urgent today than it was before the AI developments of the past few months.

Wait, what?

The thing is, when Bill Gates gushes with excitement over the new "Age of AI", he isn't being hyperbolic or bombastic. So, given the rapid, exponential pace of AI development, is he right to dismiss the threat of AI malevolence so casually?

Itâ€™s the great AI oil rush and the finite resource is all our digital data. But will anybody bother to learn how to write and keep generating new data? What happens when we run out? Will the AI become recursive, eventually cannibalizing itself. Or will it evolve?

I'm beginning to feel increasingly uneasy at the rapid pace of AI development, while at the same time finding it incredible useful.

* Maybe open with the banks collapsing and other such "ides"? But AI is more significant and important
* Talk about the rapid pace of development - Refer to
* Talk about your "toot" - Microsoft vs Apple
* Set the record straight on "What is a wordbit, anyway?" by chatgpt
* The introduction of ChatGPT4 and Microsoft's recent moves in the space...

The idea that AI will lessen our workload and give us more free time:

Will AI create more BS, or will we actually work less?

There is still momentum for the four-day work week, but they are missing the point by squeezing 40 hours into four days:

* maybe mention that when audio and visual AI hits, we're going to see more censorship (making James Bond woke for example -real thing). More "fake news" but also customized movies and songs - "create a new humphrey bogart movie"
