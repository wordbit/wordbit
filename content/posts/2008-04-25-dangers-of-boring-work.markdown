Have you ever had a job that bored you into zombie mode faster than Seabiscuit on steroids? According to [this BBC article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7358863.stm), scientists have developed a headset that measures when our brains are about to switch into autopilot mode. This state of cognitive rest is the brain's way of saving cogitations for something more mentally taxing like what to make for dinner tonight. 

Going brain dead is all very well if you're gluing hula skirts onto tiki dolls on an assembly line, but what about if you're, say, an air traffic controller? This device could improve workplace safety (and cut down on all those WCB claims).

Looking at the design, though, I'd say they still have a long way to go before any employee consents to sporting this stylish headgear in comfort.
