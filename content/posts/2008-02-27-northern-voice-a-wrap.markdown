I'm glad I was able to attend Northern Voice this year - it was informative and inspiring for the most part. All the clicking laptops around me were a bit daunting, but gave me something to aspire to. 

The morning kicked off with the keynote address by [Matt Mullenweg](http://ma.tt), founder of Wordpress (the excellent blogging platform on which this website is based). Listen to [the audio](http://atlargemedia.com/content/podcast-matt-mullenweg-keynote-northern-voice-2008) here.

I then listened to a talk by the CEO of Broadband Mechanics, [Marc Canter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Canter) on bringing social to software. Next was an inspirational diatribe on the state of our stats-obsessed blogging world by [Dave Olson](http://uncleweed.net/).

In the afternoon, Alan Levine gave us [50 web 2.0 ways to tell a story](http://cogdogroo.wikispaces.com/50+Ways) (his was a tearjerker about a dog). Vancouver photographer [Kris Krug](http://kriskrug.com/) then faced off against his mentor [Alex Waterhouse-Hayward](http://www.alexwaterhousehayward.com/index.php) on the best medium for photography - hard copy or digital?

Finally, [Rob Cottingham](http://www.socialsignal.com/blog/rob-cottingham) gave a talk called Blogger 911, about using blogs for crisis communications, something we're doing a lot of in PR class. He also draws some great cartoons about social media - check them out on his page. 

Overall it was worth going and I'll be going next year - hopefully with a laptop this time!
