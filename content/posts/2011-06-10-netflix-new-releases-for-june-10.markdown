There's not a lot to recommend in the latest releases.

But if I had to pick, I'd go with the critic darling _Waltz with Bashir_, even though it looks like a bit of a downer.

Director Ari Folman employs vivid black-and-white animation in this Golden Globe-winning film, exploring the memory gaps in his life during his service for the Israeli army in the Lebanese war of the early 1980s.
