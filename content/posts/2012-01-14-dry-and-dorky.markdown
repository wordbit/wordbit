I came upon this recently - perhaps you've seen it in your neighbourhood? Nah, didn't think so. This atrocious umbrella is a fantastic example of great engineering, but poor design. Terrible, insufferable design.




The [Nubrella](http://nubrella.com/) has a spec sheet that would make a meteorologist drool: aerodynamic, ergonomic, hands-free, and will never invert in a hurricane-force gale. But the trade-off is that you are transformed into a giant bobble head.




Nubrella, you can shower me with pictures of fashionable models sporting this monstrosity all you want but that will never impute a sense of style to your product. You can now join [Vibram Five Fingers](http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/index.htm) and [full-body mosquito nets](http://www.rei.com/product/800965/mombasa-mosquito-insect-shield-net-body-suit) in the pantheon of most embarrassing trends of the 21st century.
