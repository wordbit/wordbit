I went with an ambiguous title for this post on purpose. Summer is usually a relaxing, carefree time. Time spent outdoors barbequing, camping, forest bathing, swimming, and hanging out in boardshorts and flip flops with a cold beer.

And, in a sense, I have been enjoying a "sick" summer - I got my second COVID-19 shot, along with a lot of other people, and with active cases at an all-time low, restrictions have eased up. I was able to take some vacation time for a few camping road trips to play in the incredible outdoor playground we have here in BC.

BC is in good shape overall - look at [the numbers](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/covid-19-british-columbia-charts-1.5510000), especially the "COVID-19 deaths per million residents" chart. We have the second-fewest deaths (Norway has the fewest).

On the other hand, we are very much experiencing a sick summer, with a brutal heat wave sending temperatures so high that even Death Valley was looking pleasant.

but

............impossible to book a campsite - resort to bush camping or backcountry

.............lakes are always closed on hot days around here - ridiculous in the second-largest country in the world

Heat wave:
