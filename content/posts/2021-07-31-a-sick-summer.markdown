I went with an ambiguous title for this post on purpose. Summer is usually a relaxing, carefree time. Time spent outdoors barbequing, camping, swimming (or forest bathing, if you prefer), and hanging out in boardshorts and flip flops with a cold beer.

And, in a sense, I have been enjoying a "sick" summer. I got my second COVID-19 shot, along with a lot of other people, and with active cases at an all-time low, restrictions have eased up. I was able to take some vacation time for a few camping road trips and play in the incredible outdoor playground we have here in BC.

BC is in good shape overall - look at [the numbers](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/covid-19-british-columbia-charts-1.5510000), especially the "COVID-19 deaths per million residents" chart. We have the second-fewest deaths (Norway has the fewest).

On the other hand, we are very much experiencing a sick summer, with a brutal heat wave in late June sending temperatures so high that even Death Valley started looking temperate. It got so bad that the town of Lytton recorded the highest temperature in Canada ever for two days before completely burning to the ground on the third day.

The heat wave kicked off an early wildfire season. Throughout July, hundreds of out-of-control fires have evacuated numerous small towns and are choking the air with smoke. We drove through some of the affected areas with the windows down (our car's air conditioning broke at an inopportune time), so I can confirm it was terrible.

but

............impossible to book a campsite - resort to bush camping or backcountry

.............lakes are always closed on hot days around here - ridiculous in the second-largest country in the world

Heat wave:
