Thanks to modern technology, Google street view now stretches just about everywhere. Even the lonely street in South Africa where I grew up in the 80s and 90s. [Here is the house my dad built](https://www.google.com/maps/@-29.7580164,30.8385298,3a,75y,35.16h,86.29t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s05bzD6CGiL1wJG4n4spwng!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1). It appears relatively unchanged. The only difference I can see is that the current occupants have removed the lopsided Christmas tree we used to have in the front yard. Over the years we lived there, my dad added a dining room and deck, servants quarters, and a swimming pool out back. Yeah, I know how it sounds but this is Africa we're talking about here, not Vancouver where you'd be lucky if your $400,000 apartment came with a washer and dryer.

The windows with the faux shutters that you can see here was my room.
