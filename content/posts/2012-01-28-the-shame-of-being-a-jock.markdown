Anyone who grew up in the 80s will remember _Revenge of the Nerds_. The movie made ruthless fun of nerds, while offering them an olive branch in the form of Hollywood catharsis. My, how times have changed.




Now, social awkwardness is endearing. Comic-book movies are cool. Gadgets, gaming, and tech are in. Kids want to be programmers and engineers. Their parents want them to do well in math and science - in short, they want their kids to be nerds.




What happened to the jocks? Are they out there somewhere, hosting secret Superbowl parties, covertly snapping towels at each other, and anxiously awaiting the release of _Revenge of the Jocks_? One thing's for sure - they're not holding their heads high anymore. The nerds won. And I for one welcome our new overlords (had to say it).
