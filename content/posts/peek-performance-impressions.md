Thank you, Apple, for giving me something to write about besides from today's unholy trinity of war, disease, and inflation.

Perhaps not as flashy as last year's [Spring Loaded]({{< relref "2021-04-30-spring-loaded.markdown" >}}) digital event, [Peek Performance](https://youtu.be/CUwg_JoNHpo) was nonetheless a nice, mellow start to the 2022 Apple news cycle. And there was one cool surprise that escaped the leaks.

This presentation was a no-nonsense, all-business affair. Given the complete lack of levity, especially from a dead-eyed Tim Cook, you get the feeling Apple is ready to move on from pre-recorded video and return to in-person events.

I have to give Apple inclusivity credit though - most of the presenters were women this time and they were all lively and engaging.

So, I'm going to start a tradition here and give my "thumbs up" and "thumbs down" impressions of each announcement as I did in last year's Spring event.

Here we go.

### Friday Night Baseball

Apple is bringing live Baseball games to Apple TV+ "free from local broadcast restrictions".
