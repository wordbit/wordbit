Thank you, Apple, for giving me something to write about besides from today's unholy trinity of war, disease, and inflation.

Perhaps not as flashy as last year's [Spring Loaded]({{< relref "2021-04-30-spring-loaded.markdown" >}}) digital event, [Peek Performance](https://youtu.be/CUwg_JoNHpo) was nonetheless a nice, mellow start to the 2022 Apple news cycle. And there was one cool surprise that escaped the leaks.

This presentation was a no-nonsense, all-business affair. Given the complete lack of levity, especially from a dead-eyed Tim Cook, you get the feeling Apple is ready to move on from pre-recorded video and return to in-person events.

I have to give Apple inclusivity credit though - most of the presenters were women this time and they were all lively and engaging.

So, I'm going to start a tradition here and give my "thumbs up" and "thumbs down" impressions of each announcement as I did in last year's Spring event.

Here we go.

### Friday Night Baseball

Apple is bringing live Baseball games to Apple TV+ "free from local broadcast restrictions".

<img src="/images/thumbs_up.png" align="left"> Dipping a pinky toe into live streaming could be the start of exciting developments for sports-loving cord cutters. Cable-network executives have another reason to lose sleep - assuming they aren't blind to the writing on the wall. Live sports and news is the last bastion of traditional cable.

<img src="/images/thumbs_down.png" align="left"> I'm not into Baseball, so maybe the yawns for this announcement are solely my own. Even so, a minor announcement like this belongs in a Press Release rather than in a tech event.

### Green iPhone 13 colours

The iPhone 13 gets a new "green" finish (yes, just "green") and the iPhone 13 Pro gets "alpine green" as it is obviously more fancy.

<img src="/images/thumbs_up.png" align="left"> Well, more colour choices are always nice for the Spring. And I think having both blue and green in the lineup are a good balance of natural colours inspired by nature. I'm reaching here, I know.

<img src="/images/thumbs_down.png" align="left"> For some reason, green-painted technology looks disgusting. There's a reason, after all, that green is one of the least popular car colours. Maybe there are a few who actually dig it, but I couldn't imagine a green option sparking a resurgence in iPhone sales.

### New iPhone SE

The new iPhone SE features the A15 chip, 5G, slightly better battery life, and stronger glass - all in the body of an iPhone 8.

<img src="/images/thumbs_up.png" align="left"> Notch haters and home-button lovers are going to be very happy this form factor is still around. Compact, capable, and long-lasting are good words to describe the SE. I'm more than familiar with the "iconic" design, having only recently moved on from my iPhone 6S. This entry-level iPhone, however, is three times faster than the 6S.

<img src="/images/thumbs_down.png" align="left"> Maybe kids and grandparents won't complain when they're handed the SE, but there's a reason anyone who is employed has moved on (myself included) to the newer iPhone X-era design. The tiny display, small battery, and single camera in the SE add up to a tired old design that is not worth $650 CAD you'll be paying (after tax).

If Apple supports this SE as long as they supported the 6S, you'll still be pulling this retro tech out of your pocket in 2029. Just think of the looks you'll get from all the cool kids wearing their AR glasses.

### iPad Air 5

Iterating on the excellent iPad Air 4 re-design introduced in 2020, this year's model includes the blazing-fast M1 chip, a 12MP front camera, and a fetching new blue colour.

<img src="/images/thumbs_up.png" align="left"> When the iPad Air 4 came out, I was [sorely tempted]({{< relref "2020-09-28-from-the-insane-to-the-mundane.markdown" >}}) to snap one up and toss my OG 2013 iPad Air away. The iPad Air 5 tempts me even more. There's no doubt that the iPad Air 5's real value proposition here is Apple's delicious homemade M1 chip. Ironically, you don't even need that much power for an iPad. But what the M1 gives you is longevity - you'd probably be good for the next decade.

<img src="/images/thumbs_down.png" align="left"> The frustrating thing for people my age is the expectation that the iPad should do more. But maybe it will never be a "traditional" computer where you can run software outside of the App Store or hook up a keyboard and mouse and expect next-level multitasking. But kids love the iPad. A touch interface is probably going to surpass older interaction models at some point in the future.

Personally, I'm convinced that the iPad is a great casual device for watching YouTube, scrolling on Twitter, or shopping on Amazon. But you can do all these things on an iPhone too. The overlap doesn't quite justify the new iPad Air's cost for me, as lovely as it is.

So, I guess I'll keep my decade-old iPad Air until the day that the YouTube and Netflix apps are no longer supported. Or until I have so much money that I don't know what else to spend it on, which doesn't seem likely (see third member of unholy trinity: inflation).

Also, rumours have it that Apple was planning on bringing OLED to the iPad Air 5, but this upgrade got pushed to another year, which is a bummer. I do have a thing for OLED, so maybe next year the temptation will become too hard to bear...
