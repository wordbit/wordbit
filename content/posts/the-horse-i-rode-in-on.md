Her name was Bailey and she was the best horse. Gentle, plodding, and content to stay in line (instead of bolt ahead like Dexter (the horse behind me bearing her unfortunate rider). Bailey's calm temperament, despite carrying a new rider, was most welcome.

It was an especially hot day in the Cariboo. Although, the unusually wet Spring kept the landscape verdant and the mosquitoes thriving. Due to the heat, our trail ride led us through more shaded forest than open plains.

I felt a good connection with Bailey - a slight tug at the reigns was sufficient to nudge her in the right direction. And when we dismounted for a rest stop, she responded to my call when the time came to mount up once more.

Given my lack of experience (does riding a horse in _Red Dead Redemption_ count?), trotting was uncomfortable at first, until I started to anticipate Bailey's rhythm and stand up in the saddle. The last time I had ridden a horse (in real life) was 18 years ago in Costa Rica, so it had been while.

I get it now. There's something so meditative and calming about swaying in the saddle, listening to the monotonous clip-clop of the hooves, trusting this magnificent animal to bear your weight on a day when it's too hot to even walk.

There's no doubt in my mind that noisy gas-guzzling cars, motorbikes, and planes have ruined this slower pace of life. Perhaps one day, the experience of driving in a car will be a special experience that tourists will pay money for. But I doubt it. There's nothing peaceful about commuting in a car - it's quite the opposite in fact. There was no road rage in the 1800s.

Maybe I'm just not a car guy, but I really believe the world needs to move on and maybe even slow back down for our own mental wellbeing.

But anyway, back to the horses. To give some context - we were camping at a horse ranch with some friends just south of 100 Mile House. I'd consider the horseback ride to be the denouement of our vacation, but we also swam a lot. There are far fewer crowds on the lakes up North, although I should warn you that there are leeches.

We were warned about the leeches, and they were a joke at first, until one of those bloodsuckers latched onto my ankle. I was on my paddleboard, exploring the beautiful Green Lake, and unwisely stepped into the shallows, where the leeches like to hang out. I have never paddled more frantically, screaming "Get the salt! Get the salt!" Sprinkling salt on the leech causes it to curl up and detach for a moment so you can remove it.

It wasn't quite like that classic scene in the movies, where the character emerges from a swamp, only to turn around and reveal a back festooned with leeches. But it was close.

But friends, don't let that dissuade you from visiting the stunning Green Lake, with water so clear, you can see straight through to the bottom all the way across. And instead of condos and garish ice-cream parlours dotting the shoreline, there are beautiful twisted trees, wild brush, and the odd field of cattle. There are, of course, some nice lakeside cabins owned by the few fortunate boomers who bought them for a song in the 70s.
