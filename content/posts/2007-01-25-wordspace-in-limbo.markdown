Dear reader,

Perhaps you are wondering why updates have been frustratingly infrequent of late at Wordspace. I share your frustration. I have been without internet at home now for about a month due to…well, you wouldn’t believe it if I told you. Anyway, let me assure you that I am working on getting it back and when I do, I can once again parlay my procrastination into fruitful blogging.

Regards,
Antoine
