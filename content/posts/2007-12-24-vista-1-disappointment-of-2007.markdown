PC World has boldly declared that Vista is not all that Microsoft promised it would be. Alex and Kevin from [Diggnation](http://revision3.com/diggnation/2007-12-20cctrax) were talking about this on their show and how they just want the latest OS despite the sacrifices in frame rates for some games. I've seen Vista in action and it looks slick, but it seems to be all flash at this point. I'm extremely satisfied with the robustness of Windows Server 2003, which is so rock solid because it was designed to administer networks. The only bad thing about it is that some software doesn't offer support for Server 2003, most notably Adobe CS3. Fortunately there is an unofficial workaround for it, so as far as I'm concerned Vista can wait.
