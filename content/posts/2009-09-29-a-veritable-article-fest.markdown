This year has been busy and exciting and just plain exhausting. But I've finally found some time to upload a bunch of the articles that I've had published this year for _alive_ and _blush_ magazines. The majority focus on green issues. I've been somewhat typecast as the devil's green advocate, being asked to find flaws in all manner of righteous green concepts. To read one, click on the image.

In it for the money: Green initiatives that are good for our <strike>ecology</strike> economy. This is one of those slightly cynical pieces. The intro comes from a really funny ad for IBM that you can [watch here on Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSNFE6eUjfY). The art department did an awesome job with this one.

The eco dilemma: Why electric cars won't save the world. Once again, an alternative look at a green _deus ex machina_ (a term, incidentally, that I had originally used in the intro - but my editor wisely replaced this rather academic term with "save the day").

Two very short pieces: Cleaning our lakes - about a government restriction of phosphates, and When TVs die - about the switchover from analog to digital and the potential aftermath of discarded TVs in our landfills.
