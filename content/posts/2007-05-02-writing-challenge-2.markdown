[![](http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/WindowsLiveWriter/WritingChallenge2_10C3C/si__prw_g1%5B8%5D.jpg)](http://plusd.itmedia.co.jp/pcuser/articles/0608/17/news062.html) You can now expel your baited breath because writing challenge number two is here! For this task, you will be required to go to [this Japanese website](http://plusd.itmedia.co.jp/pcuser/articles/0608/17/news062.html) and view the images. I'm assuming you cannot read Japanese, so the challenge before you is to decipher what this product is based on the images alone. Can you figure out just what this newfangled USB device does? A little research might help you out! The winner will bask in the glory of being the writing challenge champion...well, until the third challenge comes along.

Good luck!
