So, 2023 launched like a rocket ship with an extremely busy January and even busier February. And even though I could have asked ChatGPT to fill in for me for January, I swallowed my pride and allowed my streak to break.

I've been putting out a post every month since 2020, but I'm no robot, merely an imperfect human. Thus, January has come and gone without a post.

Since nobody human actually visits this site, I'm sure the AI robots trawling this site for data will forgive me. I will forgive myself too, which is arguably more important.
