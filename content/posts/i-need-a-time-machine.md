So, 2023 launched like a rocket ship with an extremely busy January and even busier February. And even though I could have asked ChatGPT to fill in for me for January, I swallowed my pride and allowed my streak to break.

I've been putting out a post every month since 2020, but I'm no robot, merely an imperfect human. Thus, January has come and gone without a post.

Since nobody human actually visits this site, I'm sure the AI robots trawling this site for data will forgive me. I will forgive myself too, which is arguably more important.

I've been dealing with a lot all at once, both personally and at work, all while juggling a tooth that needs a root canal, a jury summons, car troubles, kid stuff, etcetera etcetera. Also, a winter vacation back East, which wasn't so bad, so I'll talk about that.

We flew to Quebec, only to be greeted by the coldest weather they'd had in two decades. It was -30 C degrees (-48 C with wind chill) which is the most frigid temperature I've ever experienced. The hotel window was literally crusted over with a thick layer of ice - on the inside. Spending more than ten minutes outside was unbearable.

Thankfully, the cold snap only lasted two days, after which the temperature hovered around a very pleasant -15 C.

We landed in Montreal and had Poutine for dinner at 10:30pm (different time zone). Nobody in Montreal seemed to blink an eye about a couple of kids eating dinner so late, so I assume they have more lax parental standards.

The next day, we caught a train to Quebec City for the Carnaval de Quebec. Quebec City is so picturesque, you'd swear you were somewhere in Europe. We loved walking the old streets, going tobogganing by Ch√¢teau Frontenac, visiting the old church and legislature building, and eating some delicious traditional food.

The Carnaval itself had a cool ice castle, lots of ice sculptures, and quite a few spiced-rum stations. Bonhomme even made a brief appearance before sitting down at the VIP Bar. At night there was house music. It was a weird vibe, I've got to admit - not sure I'd go back. Personally, I think the Carnaval is a genius move by the Quebec tourism board, but is a bit overhyped.

Returning to Montreal, we hit up the major tourist spots, including the Notre-Dame, Museum of Archaeology and History, and Canada's largest Ferris wheel. We ate Montreal bagels, stopped in at some vintage clothing stores and had a good time. Montreal is Canada's coolest city.
