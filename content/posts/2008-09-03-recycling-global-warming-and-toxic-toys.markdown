I haven't blogged in a while, and as Uncle Argyle says "Well that's something we shall have to remedy, isn't it" (That quote is from _Braveheart_, just in case you haven't seen one of the greatest movies ever made).

The first article is a couple of shorts on the nine most vulnerable areas on planet Earth and toxic toys. The second is an article on why recycling religiously doesn't necessarily make you a saint.
