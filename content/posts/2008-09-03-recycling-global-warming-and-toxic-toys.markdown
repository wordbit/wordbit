I haven't blogged in a while, and as Uncle Argyle says "Well that's something we shall have to remedy, isn't it" (That quote is from _Braveheart_, just in case you haven't seen one of the greatest movies ever made). Unfortunately I'm keeping it short today - here are two of my articles from _alive_ magazine's July and August issues respectively. Click on the thumbnails to view them.

The first article is a couple of shorts on the nine most vulnerable areas on planet Earth and toxic toys. The second is an article on why recycling religiously doesn't necessarily make you a saint.
