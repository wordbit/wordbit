The [New York Times](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/30/the-rise-of-the-toilet-texter/) recently reported that 91 percent of Americans aged 28-35 have used their mobile devices while on the toilet. Disturbingly, 20 percent of men and 13 percent of women have participated in a conference call from the john. Never before has the MUTE key played such an indispensable role.




Yet, while these statistics may leave you shaking your head in disgust (or not, if you're sitting on the throne while you read this), some companies are taking the initiative. Statistics can sometimes help you find a niche market, as the start-up [HzO](http://hzo.me/) is no doubt counting on. They're developing a nanotechnology coating that will waterproof your phone. They were a big hit at CES, and are sure to make a splash in the industry this year.




I just wish they would be more honest in their marketing material. They talk about accidentally jumping in a pool with your phone in your pocket, or having an outdoor conversation during a torrential rain storm. The likelihood of these events happening are actually very minuscule. Why not just come out and say it - we are there to help when your phone goes plop. Full stop.
