I'm back on-line again, which is really cool. I think it's been about two or three years. Anyway, I'm typing this right now on my [_Deepest Sender_](http://deepestsender.mozdev.org/) extension for [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/), which is my new favourite browser! Internet Explorer has already become a distant memory. 

Look for more to come soon!
