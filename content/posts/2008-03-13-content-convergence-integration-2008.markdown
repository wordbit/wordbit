This conference kicked off in Vancouver today and is _the_ place to be if you're facing content management issues in your professional life as a technical writer, or if you want to stay on the leading edge of developments in the field. Each day has a specific theme. Day 1 (today) is about content, day 2 about technology, and day 3 about user relationships. I'll be volunteering there the whole day tomorrow, and will tell you all about it later (if you're going, be sure to say hello).

Highlights? The future of XML publishing, the new Quark dynamic publishing demos, social media, mobile content management , and of course, the fabulous food.
