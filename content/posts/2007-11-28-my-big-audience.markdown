![853246_27495155](http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/853246_27495155.jpg) I was trying to figure out how many people are reading my writing/editing and the numbers are pretty huge. First of all, I've been writing for the print edition of [alive](http://alive.com) at a readership of about 500,000. Then every Tuesday articles I've edited for [Metro Canada](http://www.metronews.ca/) comes out countrywide at a readership of 700,000. And the tips of the day I write for Living Naturally are published on at least 7000 websites in the US and Canada, according to [this Google search](http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&safe=off&q=%22This+internet+site+is+hosted+by+Living+Naturally%2C+a+Web+site+service+provider+to+natural+health+stores+nationwide.%22+&btnG=Search&meta=). Of course my name is only attached to the stuff I write in the magazine, but still, that's a large audience to consider. 

Sometimes I'm having an off day and rush through an article that 700,000 people are going to read. Then, when it comes out, I look at it and think "I can't believe this drivel got published. I really should have spent more time on this..." Or "Ultimate Frisbee in December? What the heck was I thinking?"  It's a humbling experience.
