![doctrain.west](http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/doctrain.west.jpg) The conference proper kicked off today with some excellent speakers across the board. There were a lot of presentations, so I'm going to keep it short and give you the gist of each one along with my personal "what's hot" recommendation on something juicy, cool or just plain geeky that I gleaned from the talk. If the slides for the talk are available online, I'll embed them as well.

So without further ado, here's my take on the presentations that I attended.

**A comparison of three visual help authoring tools**   
_Neil Perlin_ (Hyper/Word Services)

Neil reviewed three authoring tools: Captivate, Camtasia, and Mimic. Each tool possesses a different feature set, so it depends what you need them for.  
What's hot: My vote for the most user-friendly tool is Adobe's [Captivate](http://www.adobe.com/products/captivate/).
