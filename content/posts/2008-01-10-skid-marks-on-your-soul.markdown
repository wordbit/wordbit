Over at Wired's video gallery you can watch some [amusing tech vintage commercials](http://www.wired.com/gadgets/miscellaneous/multimedia/2008/01/gallery_vintage_ads). While I find the ones for the old Mac, the Vic-20, and the Commodore chuckle worthy, my vote for the funniest - and the most creative - goes to the 1980s ad for the Atari 5200's _Pole Position_. Back in those days, the marketing strategy was basically to show as little of the game's graphics as possible while hyping up the game in various ridiculous ways. That made for some highly creative advertising. Check out this howler:

Don't you love the cheesy model car that gets picked up by the "giant" hand?
