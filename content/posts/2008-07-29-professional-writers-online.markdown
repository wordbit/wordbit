[![exploring](http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/exploring_thumb.jpg)](http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/exploring.jpg) It's been about four months since my classmates and I graduated from the Print Futures Professional Writing Program. If you're serious about your craft and are thinking of attending this two-year diploma program, I heartily encourage you to go for it. I love to write and I love getting paid to do it even more. But don't kid yourself - writing well works up a mental sweat for every writer, whether oozing with talent or not. 

I thought I'd acknowledge some of my graduated colleagues who have websites online. The reason most of the sites on the list below are not on my blogroll is because they're static pages. In other words, they're not regularly updated - which is a little unfortunate in my opinion because I love to read what people are up to in the minutiae of their lives and enjoy reading the blogs of people I know. I almost never check in with static pages. Facebook's great, but is more like a sophisticated telegraphing machine than a home you can personalize and make your own.
