Post-apocalyptic books such as _The Road_, or TV shows such as _The Walking Dead_ give us a glimpse into the aftermath of an extinction event where only tenacious bands of humans are left to cling to survival. But what if there were simulations of such scenarios - how would a mad scramble for remaining resources actually play out?

With online multiplayer games such as _Day Z_ and _Rust_, we can now find out. _Rust_, in particular, has dispensed with the zombie conceit and stripped the game down to bare-knuckle survival of the chop-firewood and mine-for-metal variety. Hordes of players are now thrown into a vast arena where they can either co-operate or fight for resources. It's basically _Hunger Games_ without the rules and controlling bureaucracy. And we all know what happened in that particular dystopia: Teen sociopaths opted to knock each other off with blunt weapons rather than band together to fight the The Man.

_Rust_ pretty much confirms that these fantasies were spot on. To survive, resource-hoarding and senseless torture of the weak is the order of the day.

Here is [a quote](http://store.steampowered.com/app/252490/) from the game's Steam page:

_"I love this game, I built a house around a guys house and made him my prisoner, I fed him cans of tuna and cooked chicken when it was available, and some times I would drop in spare logs of wood(when they were available). The best part. he talks to me, keeps telling me his clans going to raid my structure and save him.. I simply respond with . "It puts the lotion on its skin, or it gets the hose again" and by hose I mean I dump charcoal on him.Â Great game hope the servers come up soon, I think my pet may need to eat."_

And here's [another quote](http://www.theverge.com/2014/2/5/5361580/dayz-will-haunt-you#214046151) from an article on _The Verge_:

_"Me and a bunch of my friends go around hand-cuffing others and then beating them to death with our fists or feeding them alcohol tincture or rotten food, d-do I pass as non-psycho?"_

The above quote being a response to the observation that _Rust_ appears to harbour more psychopaths that other online games. He was being facetious, but you get the idea. Players who are otherwise ordinary law-abiding citizens turn into monsters when loosed in a world that supports - even encourages - amoralistic behaviour in order to stay alive.

We've all seen the looting and mayhem that occurs after a natural disaster, or even during riots. Would the next step be a reprehensible form of desperation that slowly morphs into a sickening sadism? With the test results leaning toward a positive in the virtual lab of _Rust_, I hope we never have to live that reality.
