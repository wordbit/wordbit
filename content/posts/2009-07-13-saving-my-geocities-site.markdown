![ma_geo_1](http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/ma_geo_1.gif) I've been taking a long break from blogging, but have been swamped with other projects and personal stuff. But I thought I'd take this opportunity for a cool retrospective trip through the interwebs. Now, you may know that Yahoo's Geocities is closing this October. Well, I've managed to save my oldest website from imminent oblivion through the painstaking process of re-coding each html file, capturing all the other files through a Firefox plug-in, and giving it a new home on this server. Ah, Geocities...those horrid, visceral backgrounds, the ghastly html code, the weird wavy headers, the site design that makes Myspace look like a contender for the User Interface award. So, why bother? Well, there is soul in this site, and a rawness that is appealing in strange sort of way. 

So, here it is. There are lots of links that don't work, but that's not the point. The point is to preserve this little piece of history so that when Geocities dies, _[Negotiating Reality](http://www.wordbit.freehostia.com/geocities)_ lives on. See you when I see you.
