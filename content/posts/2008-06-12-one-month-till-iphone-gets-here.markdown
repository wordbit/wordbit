![phone](http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/phone.png) Is it worth switching carriers for? It certainly is tempting. Sweet 3G, the 2.0 software update and a price tag of (only) $199 on a three-year contract. Both Fido and Rogers will be launching the device on July 11 - but I happen to be with Telus. If I had a lame plan I'd drop Telus in a nanosecond. The problem is, I'm getting a pretty good deal right now - a carry-over from the time when you got unlimited evenings and weekends by default.

I could always shell out an extra hundred for the iPod touch. Not that I even like Apple that much. No really, I don't. All flash and no substance. Seriously. Sleek and sexy - who needs it. Not me.
