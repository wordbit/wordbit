[![car](http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/car.jpg)](http://www.teslamotors.com/) The auto industry may have killed the electric car a few years ago, but it's back - and dude, this is one sweet ride. Yes, going green has never been so self-indulgent...or pricey for that matter. [The Tesla Roadster](http://www.teslamotors.com/) is a 100% electric and is available in the US and Europe, but you have to reserve it. All 2008 models are sold and in production, but you can snag a 2009 model for a mere $109,000. This is no entry level vehicle, but nice to see electric is bringing sexy back.
