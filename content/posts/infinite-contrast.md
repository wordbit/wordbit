Most people love colour.

In nature, colour serves a biological purpose - whether it serves as camouflage, a warning (don't eat me!), or as an advertisement to the opposite sex.

In art, we try to mimic nature. Pigments mixed to the precise hue and saturation of a myriad of colours bring a painting to startling life.

In technology, we try to mimic art. Only bright displays with a wide colour gamut are likely to dazzle shoppers strolling through the TV gallery at Best Buy.

Colour affects our moods - we personalize our clothes, decorate our homes, and choose our foods based on colour. Right from the start of life, every kid has a favourite colour.

At its essence, colour is light. Or more precisely, colours are light waves reflected off an object into the optic nerves of our eyes.

The opposite of light is, of course, darkness. A lot of people are scared of the dark. There is also a biological reason for this, as the most dangerous predators are nocturnal. It's hard to erase a few millions years of evolution.

Complete darkness, as you would find deep in a cave underground, is truly black. Black is the absence of colour. It is not celebrated. Only weird Goths or funeral attendees dress all in black. Only serial killers and Marilyn Manson paint their walls black.

But as a counterpoint to colour, black is essential.

Most of the time, when we say something is black, it is actually a variation of dark grey. If you've ever tried and failed to see your hand in that aforementioned underground cave, then you've experienced true black. But true black is hard to replicate in nature, art, or technology because light always reflects off "black" objects.

That doesn't mean humans haven't tried. The "blackest" material on earth is [Vantablack](https://magazine.artland.com/in-search-of-the-blackest-black/). Reflecting less than 0.04 % of incident light, the sensors in cameras can't even pick it up, rendering Vantablack invisible to the camera's eye.

But for colours to really pop you need true black. Simply put, true black is an absolute prerequisite if you want to most accurate image possible.

This extremely long preamble is the reason why OLED screens are so well-regarded and why spending more on an OLED is absolutely worth it. This extremely long preamble is also my way of avoiding the overused word "inky" when describing this technology.

OLED screens can display true blacks because each individual pixel turns on or off to product light. LCD screens, on the other hand, use a backlight to illuminate pixels. As the backlight is always on, dark areas in the display are always grey, never black.

And yet, despite their superior image quality, OLED displays only accounted for [30 percent of the global display market](https://www.oled-a.org/2021-oled-panel-yy-shipments-and-revenue-up-47-and-273-respectively_070421.html) in 2021.
