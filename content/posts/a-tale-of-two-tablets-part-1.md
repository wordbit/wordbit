A lot of people were excited about the new iPads coming in October this year. As usual, the wild rumours had some people pumped. But what we got didn't quite live up to the hype. In fact, it set a new low bar. Let's dive into it.

It's been twelve years since Steve Jobs first introduced the iPad. It was a revelation at the time. Before 2010, touch-screen tablets only existed in [Star Trek](https://youtu.be/yVqHoGKQXLI).

Everybody wanted one. Initial sales were so high, many thought the laptop's days were numbered and a new age of touch-screen computing had begun. Over the next three years, the iPad got thinner, lighter, and even more powerful, culminating in the first iPad Air  in 2013 - a beautiful, sleek tablet that was so good, I could resist no longer and picked one up for myself.

Ten years on, and I'm still using that iPad Air. Even though it is still a great YouTube machine, it is frustratingly slow and outdated. So, I decided that this will be the year that I upgrade. The fact that I've been happy with the first-gen iPad Air for this long is a testament to how good it is. But it is also an indication that iPads never quite took off as computers. And by "computers", I mean productivity machines that you do "work" on.

This tension is a common theme among tech enthusiasts, and if you're one of those, you've no doubt come across this question before: Why is the iPad's software holding back such powerful hardware?

Well, I'm not really interested in answering that question.

I've long come to accept what the iPad is. It's fun and casual. You relax in bed with it. Like a phone, it's easy to pick up and instantly look something up. But unlike a phone, the big screen let's you spend a few minutes on a noncommittal mobile game without squinting. It's great for family FaceTime calls. It's perfect for watching short videos.

The iPad has never had multi-user accounts. It's a personal, intimate device and without the  burdensome association of "work", it's a device you can simply enjoy using in your free time. I think that last point is an important one - nobody thinks of their work laptops fondly, but people love their iPads.

The problem is that Americans are obsessed with productivity. And all those geeks who work on computers everyday look at the iPad with a jealous gaze. They want to take the fun, carefree iPad and turn it into a workhorse. They have cried, and cried, and cried to Apple - a loud minority who wants better multi-tasking, better file management, an iPad that runs macOS and desktop-class apps, and so on.

So, in 2015, Apple tried to appease them with the iPad Pro.

In his latest podcast, Gruber speculates that it was COVID and supply-chain issues resulting from a decision made two years ago.

Include some extras, like LOTR and Amazon Prime?
