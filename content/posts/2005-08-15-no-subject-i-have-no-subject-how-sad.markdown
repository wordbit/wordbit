I've moved back to the beach! I'm living in White Rock and cruising around in my smartie-red Echo. I'm still working, but don't have any disposable income. What else is there to say? The summer has been good, I've been doing a lot of hiking and swimming and enjoying the sunshine. Well, now I feel awkward, breaking my diary comments with inane comments. I'll be going now, I hope everyone is doing splendiferously.
