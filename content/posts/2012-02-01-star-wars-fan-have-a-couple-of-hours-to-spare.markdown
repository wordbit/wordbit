Star Wars fan? Have a couple of hours to spare? Here's an epic fan-made movie for you. Star Wars fans were each given 15 seconds of _Star Wars IV: A New Hope_. Contributors put their allotted scene together however they wanted without seeing each others. Then all the scenes were stitched together into the final product - a bizarre rendition of the entire Star Wars movie. Just like the classic drawing game _Heads, Bodies, and Tails_, hilarity ensues.
