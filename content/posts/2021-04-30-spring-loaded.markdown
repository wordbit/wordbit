In Apple's recent _Spring Loaded_ event, the landscaping at Apple Park was on point. The path sightlines, the balance of trees and shrubbery, the striking wooden decks - even the mulch - was all so pleasant to look at in its verdant splendour.

As Tim Cook strolled through the starkly empty courtyard grounds, around the shallow pool with its form-fitting crescent-shaped bench, in front of the rainbow arches, it became abundantly clear that working at the richest company on Planet Earth has its perks.

Criticize Apple all you want for creating a suburban oasis instead of a practical urban headquarters with better public transit options. But if you had the choice of spending your working days inside a grungy city office building or outdoors on a sunny California patio with views straight out of a manicured Airbnb listing, which would you pick?

I'm enjoying these polished online presentations - hopefully they don't go away completely when traditional in-person events come back. I will miss strolling through Apple Park with Tim.

True to the event name, a plethora of product announcements were crammed into the hour. These were a mixed bag, from podcast subscriptions to purple iPhones to a Ted Lasso trailer. Fairly minor stuff. If I were forced to come up with a theme, however, I'd say the common thread - with one exception - was a focus on the average (non-nerdy) consumer.

Ordinary people, living ordinary - if somewhat privileged - lives (they can afford Apple products after all).  From the family struggling to work from home, to the eco-conscious biker dude, to the hirsute, underdressed silicon-valley guy working on the Ferry. Apple's marketing department knows their audience - or, at least, thinks they do.

For a full rundown of the event, go to your favourite tech publication. For a quick take, stick around here; I'm going to break down the major announcements with a subjective pro and con for each.

### AirTags

<img src="/images/thumbs_up.png" align="left"> Instead of requiring users to download an app - looking at you Tile - this little tracker is seamlessly integrated into Apple's existing operating systems. On a macro level, AirTags create an ad hoc surveillance network by piggybacking off the location of millions of iPhone users wondering around in the world with Bluetooth turned on. For the record, that's a lot. At least in areas where iPhones are popular. Despite how creepy this feature sounds, Apple worked the privacy angle hard.

On a micro level, the ultra-wideband chip in Apple's newer devices allow you to find AirTags with fine-grained precision. Remember those 

Notes:

* Apple Park looking green and verdant
* Apple Card: shared account, Apple Card family
* New Podcast app, podcast subscriptions
* New purple iPhone 12
* Find My. (That deck!!!)
* AirTags - can personalize. Very precise tracking!
* Ted Lasso trailer, coming July 23
* New Apple TV 4K, A12 bionic, high-framerate HDR, can use iphone to calibrate TV! New remote. Still expensive
* new imac! still has big chin and big bezels. Great colours. very thin. Much better camera for video calls. 24 inches. Better speakersâ€¦ very fast obviously. IMO, should have made it all screen and increased thickness. Ethernet jack in power adapter - nice. Colour-matched keyboard with touch id - nice. Colour-matched mouse too. No 27-inch option?
* Tim Cook M1 heist - so funny
* New iPad Pro has M1 - basically same design, thunderbolt port, 5G, new cameras with ultrawide camera with center stage - keeps people in view. New XDR display on 12.9 inch version - mini LED
