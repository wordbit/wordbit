In Apple's recent _Spring Loaded_ event, the landscaping at Apple Park was on point. The path sightlines, the balance of trees and shrubbery, the striking wooden decks - even the mulch - was all so pleasant to look at in its verdant splendour.

As Tim Cook strolled through the starkly empty courtyard grounds, around the shallow pool with its form-fitting crescent-shaped bench, in front of the rainbow arches, it became abundantly clear that working at the richest company on Planet Earth has its perks.

Criticize Apple all you want for creating a suburban oasis instead of a practical urban headquarters with better public transit options. But if you had the choice of spending your working days inside a grungy city office building or outdoors on a sunny California patio straight out of a manicured Airbnb listing, which would you pick?

Notes:

* Apple Park looking green and verdant
* Apple Card: shared account, Apple Card family
* New Podcast app, podcast subscriptions
* New purple iPhone 12
* Find My. (That deck!!!)
* AirTags - can personalize. Very precise tracking!
* Ted Lasso trailer, coming July 23
* New Apple TV 4K, A12 bionic, high-framerate HDR, can use iphone to calibrate TV! New remote. Still expensive
* new imac! still has big chin and big bezels. Great colours. very thin. Much better camera for video calls. 24 inches. Better speakersâ€¦ very fast obviously. IMO, should have made it all screen and increased thickness. Ethernet jack in power adapter - nice. Colour-matched keyboard with touch id - nice. Colour-matched mouse too. No 27-inch option?
* Tim Cook M1 heist - so funny
* New iPad Pro has M1 - basically same design, thunderbolt port, 5G, new cameras with ultrawide camera with center stage - keeps people in view. New XDR display on 12.9 inch version - mini LED
