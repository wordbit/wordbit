In the recent _Spring Loaded_ Apple event, the landscaping at Apple Park was on point.

Notes:

* Apple Park looking green and verdant
* Apple Card: shared account, Apple Card family
* New Podcast app, podcast subscriptions
* New purple iPhone 12
* Find My. (That deck!!!)
* AirTags - can personalize. Very precise tracking!
* Ted Lasso trailer, coming July 23
* New Apple TV 4K, A12 bionic, high-framerate HDR, can use iphone to calibrate TV! New remote. Still expensive
* new imac! still has big chin and big bezels. Great colours. very thin. Much better camera for video calls. 24 inches. Better speakersâ€¦ very fast obviously. IMO, should have made it all screen and increased thickness. Ethernet jack in power adapter - nice. Colour-matched keyboard with touch id - nice. Colour-matched mouse too. No 27-inch option?
* Tim Cook M1 heist - so funny
* New iPad Pro has M1 - basically same design, thunderbolt port, 5G, new cameras with ultrawide camera with center stage - keeps people in view. New XDR display on 12.9 inch version - mini LED
