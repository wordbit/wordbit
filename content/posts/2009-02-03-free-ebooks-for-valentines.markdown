![boxshot](http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/boxshot.jpg) I wish I had more time to blog this month, but alas, you can look forward to a paucity of blog posts. Even my tweets are running dry. So, in the meantime, what better way to get your reading fix than to indulge in some licentious drivel. To celebrate 60 years of "pure reading pleasure", [Harlequin is offering 16 free eBooks for download](http://harlequincelebrates.com/) in various formats including PDF, ePub, eReader, and MS Reader.

Even if you're not into this genre, and admittedly, I'm hardly the target audience either - do you know how lucrative this market actually is? A few years ago, I got a book called "The Art of Romance Writing" as a gag gift, but am now seriously thinking of writing a racy novel and retiring on the inevitable movie deal.
