Welcome to wordspace. A place for my words to breathe. I’ve spent a fair bit of time building this website using PHP, MYSQL and the Wordpress engine. The template was designed by a webmaster called Nik. I got the ideas from Derek Miller - writer, editor and web guy. This is an organic project, and it’s just for fun really, but I plan on gradually making improvements to it as time permits. The neat features available at the moment are customizable wallpapers - you can choose what wallpaper you want to see by clicking on the squares above. Also, you can subscribe to my RRS feed, if you don’t know what that is, [click here](http://www.mezzoblue.com/subscribe/about/).

You can search for blog entries by category in the Wordpress engine too, which is way cooler than blogger. I plan on uploading some of the writing I’m doing in the Print Futures Professional Writing program, and maybe getting some of my fellow wordsmiths up there too. With their permission of course.
