You may or may not recall that the school I work for published a little thing about teaching that I wrote, well they botched it up somewhat on the internet version, it got cut off, but it's cool to see so many South Africans teaching in Korea. That guy Nardus - he's South African who lives in New Zealand - I met him when I went to Japan, he has a degree in Anthropology and is a good guy. Anyways, check out the [Wonderland website](http://www.wonderland.or.kr/webzine/main.htm) and read my article and the others for a laugh. Click on the only window with English writing to get there.
