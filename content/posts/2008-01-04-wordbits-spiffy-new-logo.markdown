Welcome to 2008! If you've been here before then you'll notice that I've finally put up a proper logo for the site. I'm quite pleased with it, but it can always be tweaked. Other upgrades for the new year are taking place as you read this. I've put up [more writing samples](http://wordbit.freehostia.com/portfolio/samples), as well as simplified the design in my portfolio. Up next will be making an editing and design section. Anyway, that's all for now - happy new year to all.
