I've been running three days a week for about two years now. Last year I took the Sun Run more seriously and got a record time:

This year I only shaved 29 seconds off last year's time:

If I want to improve next year, then some serious training is in order. Then again, perhaps it's time to retire as I've managed to keep my number 2 spot in the company. For 2012, I may just do the 2KM walk with BabGi in the stroller. That doesn't mean I'm going to stop my tri-weekly runs though.
