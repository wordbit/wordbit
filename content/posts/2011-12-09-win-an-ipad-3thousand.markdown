I’d like to reward all my loyal readers with a chance to win the iPad 3000! Featuring a holographic, 4D display with a synaptic interface, the iPad 3000 is sure to blow everybody’s mind. Just tell me how awesome I am, tell your friends how awesome I am, tweet about me, write about this competition in your Facebook status, create a Youtube video telling me why you want to win one of these beauties, drive traffic to my blog, and leave a comment with a valid email address! When the iPad 3000 is released sometime in the 51st century, I’ll pick a winner.

 

Good luck to all! And thanks for reading. No really, thanks.
