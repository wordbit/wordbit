I took some pictures with my new digital camera this week, and have painstakingly put them up on my website, [so click here and check it out](http://www.geocities.com/antoinehenrigiraud/photo6.html). I had a good week-end, got lots of fresh air, ate some Indian food on Saturday night, rested up. I'm not looking forward to this week though. Anyways, better get some sleep, starting off the week in zombie-mode never bodes well for the rest of the week, although I think at this point it's inevitable.
