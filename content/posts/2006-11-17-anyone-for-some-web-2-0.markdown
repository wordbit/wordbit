A couple of things.

Firstly, I've been having some MySQL database issues with my Awardspace web hosting server. So, if you get the Wordpress error page when you go to [w o r d s p a c e](http://wordspace.awardspace.com/), check back later.

Secondly, wasn't that storm yesterday insane? It took out the power grid south of the Fraser and now [the Vancouver Water Board has issued a warning](http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=0b502e59-ecc2-421f-a89b-4d0192fb5407&k=88419) not to drink the muddy discoloured water that bears a resemblance to weak tea. Duh.

Thirdly, the web 2.0 buzz, like it or not, is here to stay. [Here is a super-sized representative directory](http://www.econsultant.com/web2/top-web2-sites-categorized-list.html) of over a thousand websites, sorted by category. I found some really useful links here, such as places to publicize your feeds and grass roots employment sites and all sorts of cool stuff. Even if you don't know what the heck web 2.0 is, you'll find a whole lot of goodies here.

One more thing. On a somewhat related topic...

As overhyped and ridiculously pedestrian as it is, I've finally given into the pressure. I've set up a [myspace page](http://www.myspace.com/wordspaces). 

I know, I know...
