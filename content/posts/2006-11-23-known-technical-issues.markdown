I had some trouble with Awardspace and one of my PHP files. It was redirecting my discussion-options page to their homepage, but I’ve fixed that now thanks to the Wordpress forums. So what that means in practical terms is that **you may now leave comments freely without registering your name or email address**.

In addition to this, I realized the **trackbacks are not working**. This is an issue with Nik’s Little Vista theme and it will take some time to figure that one out.

By the way, this is all a giant procrastination technique to get out of writing my interpersonal communications paper. I suck.
