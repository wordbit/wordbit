![apple-sucks](http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/apple-sucks.jpg) Not all of Apple's offerings are shiny and perfect. And when it comes to iTunes, most sane people will agree that this music player is just plain ugly. I applaud Scott Gilberson for calling it like it is in his blog post, ["The Top Ten Reasons iTunes Sucks"](http://www.webmonkey.com/blog/The_Top_Ten_Reasons_iTunes_Sucks). Here are his main beefs:


<!-- more -->
 

1. It's a store stupid  
2. The library manager is prehistoric  
3. No web browser/Wikipedia/anything  
4. No plug-in architecture  
5. Massive memory footprint  
6. No support for other music formats Ogg/FLAC/etc.  
7. Drag and drop sucks  
8. Bloatware downloads  
9. Can't use iPod as a music transport with iTunes  
10. iTunes is slow

I can't stand iTunes. Every time I open it (which, admittedly isn't very often), it wants to upgrade and install all sorts of memory and bandwidth leeches. The only feature I like is the party shuffle. But I don't have many parties.
