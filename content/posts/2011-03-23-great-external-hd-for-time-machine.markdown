I picked up this great little 1 terabyte external hard drive for only about $100 so that I could backup my iMac. It was designed to stack with the mac mini, but works flawlessly with the iMac too. The FireWire 800 connection is super fast, and I backed up about 100GB in less than an hour. In general, it's better to store precious personal media (like Wedding pictures for example) on multiple mediums,  such as DVD, solid state flash storage, and and least two hard drives. Backups of backups is not a bad plan when everything is so ephemeral nowadays. But, for a little piece of mind, even this one layer of backup is a good solution.
