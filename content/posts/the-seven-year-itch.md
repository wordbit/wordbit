I was pretty excited when [I found out]({{< relref "2021-06-18-how-are-you-still-alive.markdown" >}}) my iPhone 6S would get an incredible of seven years of software support (up to at least the end of 2022). In fact, if you're a regular reader of this blog, you're probably sick of me crowing about how my 6S marches on when Android equivalents lie long dead in the grave.

Which is why I feel terrible about this.

6S, I'm ditching you.

Actually, I don't feel that terrible. I guess I could stick it out it until the bitter end, but the truth is that the end-of-life stage is never pretty. The performance of my 6S is really choking, especially when it comes to the shutter speed on the camera. It's a familiar sign of old age - when it takes a few seconds to snap one picture, you know the end is near.

The battery life is even worse, as to be expected on the second-thinnest iPhone ever made (the iPhone 6 is the thinnest). I'm used to plugging in my 6S every couple of hours, but that's no way to live.

Admittedly, this drop in performance is typical of any new iOS version, which typically gets a lot better after a few iterations - iOS 15 is no exception. But man, I just can't stomach the thought of spending a seventh year with the 6S - life's just too short.

So, having made that decision - what's My Next?

<!--more-->

First off, I'm not even thinking about jumping ship to Android. I'm not only deeply entrenched in the Apple ecosystem, but am also not enthused by the latest Android flagships.

Out of all the current offerings, I think Google Pixels offer the purest Android experience. But they're way too big and the massive "camera visor" tacked onto the back is atrocious. Google has guaranteed software support for three years, but... well, I think you know how I feel about that. Piddling.

On the other hand, I'm not excited about the latest-and-greatest [iPhone 13]({{< relref "2021-09-17-fitter-happier-more-productive.markdown" >}}) either. What I've stated previously at great length on this blog still stands - I'm not going to settle. I'm still waiting for the notchless all-screen dream iPhone. I just need to amend my stand slightly: I'm still waiting _to throw all my money_ at a notchless all-screen dream iPhone.

You see, according to the rumours, the earliest we might be seeing that dream iPhone is in 2023. So, I don't need a new iPhone that's going to last me another seven years - I just need a transitionary iPhone that will last me another two or three years.

After extensive analysis of the market, I've calculated the average cost of an iPhone to be about $150 per year of software support. So, I set a budget of around $450 CAD to get me to three years. I won't go into the details of how I arrived at this number, and there are many other variables to consider, but it's a solid ballpark figure.

This budget immediately rules out buying any new iPhones in Apple's current lineup: so, in addition to the iPhone 13 and 13 Pro being off the table, that also removes the iPhone SE, iPhone 11, and iPhone 12 from consideration.

As you can only find older iPhone models as used or refurbished, it was time to go hunting in the wild where - if you're not careful - you might get mugged in an alleyway on a Craigslist deal gone sour. But which model?

I looked at all my options, considered carefully, and watched an embarrassing number of YouTube videos (even the bottom-of-the-barrel ones with hardly any views). The answer I arrived at surprised even me:

The iPhone XS.

A rather underrated iPhone that debuted in 2018, [I barely gave it any thought]({{< relref "2018-11-06-i-dont-feel-bad.markdown" >}}) when it was originally released. I did, however, express a preference for the blue or red iPhone XR. As an "S" year update, the XS predictably didn't get much attention because it looked exactly like the iPhone X. But the iPhone XS checks so many boxes for me - in fact, I managed to come up with ten reasons why the iPhone XS is the perfect phone for me to buy right now:

 1. The iPhone XS is three years newer than my iPhone 6S and three years older than the latest iPhone 13, so it sits right in the middle of the last six-year time period.

    Yes, the last three years have brought a lot of cool tech to the iPhone, including impressive new cameras with night mode (and an Ultra Wide lens), 5G, MagSafe, and LiDAR. Also, iPhones always improve with each generation, with faster processors, more battery life, and nicer screens that are harder to crack.

    But by the same token, look what I get for three years of development: a telephoto and wide-angle camera, IP-certified water and dust resistance, wireless charging, Face ID, and a larger edge-to-edge OLED display with small bezels (including, sigh, a notch I will have to actually live with now). And when you experience it, the bonuses of a faster processor, more battery life, and nicer screen are considerable quality-of-life improvements.

NOTES:

* All the cool new features in iOS 15 are supported on XS or newer: [https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/news/new-ios-15-features-require-iphone-xs-above/](https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/news/new-ios-15-features-require-iphone-xs-above/ "https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/news/new-ios-15-features-require-iphone-xs-above/") Verify if this is because of the neural engine...
* It is three years older than 6S, but three years older than the newest iPhone, so, right in the middle.
* It’s the last phone to come out before Apple split the line into unaffordable “Pro” models.
* On the second-hand market, they are priced the same as XR, but are much more premium with stainless steel frame, OLED screen, small bezels, two cameras, etc.
* The discount is huge. Originally cost $1544 CAD after tax, but around $400 now, so over a thousand bucks cheaper. [https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/09/12/iphone-xs-max-iphone-xr-canadian-specs-pricing-availability/](https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/09/12/iphone-xs-max-iphone-xr-canadian-specs-pricing-availability/ "https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/09/12/iphone-xs-max-iphone-xr-canadian-specs-pricing-availability/")
* I want it to last until at least 2023, and that is almost guaranteed with the A12 chip.
* It is the same width as the iPhone 13 Pro, which is sleeker and nicer in the hand than the wider iPhone XR and 11. [https://www.hotspot3d.com/#compare/apple-iphone-xs-silver/apple-iphone-13-pro-silver](https://www.hotspot3d.com/#compare/apple-iphone-xs-silver/apple-iphone-13-pro-silver "https://www.hotspot3d.com/#compare/apple-iphone-xs-silver/apple-iphone-13-pro-silver")
* It has 4GB of RAM which is twice as much as the 6S and one more than the iPhone X, which had 3GB. I believe this will make a difference for future iOS support where the iPhone 6 was cut off early because it only had 1GB of RAM. Also, need to verify, but I heard all the base models of iPhone up to the 13 have 4GB RAM.
* First 7 nanometer chip! And better neural engine - hence full support for iOS 15.
* Battery only has moderate improvement, but the XS does have fast charge capability (50% charge in 30 minutes).

A bit dramatic, but could use this article in the post:

[https://www.phonearena.com/news/Upgrading-your-phone-could-cost-you-your-retirement_id135906](https://www.phonearena.com/news/Upgrading-your-phone-could-cost-you-your-retirement_id135906 "https://www.phonearena.com/news/Upgrading-your-phone-could-cost-you-your-retirement_id135906")

I like the premium, understated design of the XS - as affirmation, take a look at the direction Android is going: ...... what's up with these terrible design choices - the Pixel 6 takes the camera bump to the next level.
