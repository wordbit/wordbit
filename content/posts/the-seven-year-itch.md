I was pretty excited when [I found out]({{< relref "2021-06-18-how-are-you-still-alive.markdown" >}}) my iPhone 6S would get an incredible of seven years of software support (up to at least the end of 2022). In fact, if you're a regular reader of this blog, you're probably sick of me crowing about how my 6S marches on when Android equivalents lie long dead in the grave.

Which is why I feel terrible about this.

6S, I'm ditching you.

Actually, I don't feel that terrible. I guess I could stick it out it until the bitter end, but the truth is that the end-of-life stage is never pretty. The performance of my 6S is really choking, especially when it comes to the shutter speed on the camera. It's a familiar sign of old age - when it takes a few seconds to snap one picture, you know the end is near.

The battery life is even worse, as to be expected on the second-thinnest iPhone ever made (the iPhone 6 is the thinnest). I'm used to plugging in my 6S every couple of hours, but that's no way to live.

Admittedly, this drop in performance is typical of any new iOS version, which typically gets a lot better after a few iterations - iOS 15 is no exception. But man, I just can't stomach the thought of spending a seventh year with the 6S - life's just too short.

So, having made that decision - what's My Next?

<!--more-->

First off, I'm not even thinking about jumping ship to Android. I'm not only deeply entrenched in the Apple ecosystem, but am also not enthused by the latest Android flagships.

Out of all the current offerings, I think Google Pixels offer the purest Android experience. But they're way too big and the massive "camera visor" tacked onto the back is atrocious. Google has guaranteed software support for three years, but... well, I think you know how I feel about that. Piddling.

On the other hand, I'm not excited about the latest-and-greatest [iPhone 13]({{< relref "2021-09-17-fitter-happier-more-productive.markdown" >}}) either. What I've stated previously at great length on this blog still stands - I'm not going to settle. I'm still waiting for the notchless all-screen dream iPhone. I just need to amend my stand slightly: I'm still waiting _to throw all my money_ at a notchless all-screen dream iPhone.

You see, according to the rumours, the earliest we might be seeing that dream iPhone is in 2023. So, I don't need a new iPhone that's going to last me another seven years - I just need a transitionary iPhone that will last me another two or three years.

After extensive analysis of the market, I've calculated the average cost of an iPhone to be about $150 per year of software support. So, I set a budget of around $450 CAD to get me to three years. I won't go into the details of how I arrived at this number, and there are many other variables to consider, but it's a solid ballpark figure.

This budget immediately rules out buying any new iPhones in Apple's current lineup: so, in addition to the iPhone 13 and 13 Pro being off the table, that also removes the iPhone SE, iPhone 11, and iPhone 12 from consideration.

As you can only find older iPhone models as used or refurbished, it was time to go hunting in the wild where - if you're not careful - you might get mugged in an alleyway on a Craigslist deal gone sour. But which model?

I looked at all my options, considered carefully, and watched an embarrassing number of YouTube videos (even the bottom-of-the-barrel ones with hardly any views). The answer I arrived at surprised even me:

The iPhone XS.

A rather underrated iPhone that debuted in 2018, [I barely gave it any thought]({{< relref "2018-11-06-i-dont-feel-bad.markdown" >}}) when it was originally released. I did, however, express a preference for the blue or red iPhone XR. As an "S" year update, the XS predictably didn't get much attention because it looked exactly like the iPhone X.

But the iPhone XS checks so many boxes for me - in fact, I managed to come up with ten reasons why the iPhone XS is the perfect phone for me to buy right now:

### 1. It's not too old and not too new

The iPhone XS is three years newer than my iPhone 6S and three years older than the latest iPhone 13, so it sits right in the middle of the last six-year time period.

Yes, the last three years have brought a lot of cool tech to the iPhone, including impressive new cameras with Night Mode (and an Ultra Wide lens), 5G, MagSafe, and LiDAR. Also, iPhones always improve with each generation, with faster processors, more battery life, and nicer screens that are harder to crack.

But by the same token, look what I get for three years of development: a wide-angle and telephoto lens with Portrait Mode, IP-certified water and dust resistance, wireless charging, Face ID, and a larger edge-to-edge OLED display with small bezels (including, sigh, a notch I will have to actually live with now). And when you experience it, the bonuses of a faster processor, more battery life, and nicer screen are considerable quality-of-life improvements.

### 2. All the cool new iOS 15 features are supported

My iPhone 6S may technically support iOS 15, but in reality it can only handle a small subset of all the cool new features.

No AI-driven features are supported, such as Spatial Audio and Portrait Mode in FaceTime, an interactive 3D globe and immersive walking directions in Maps, Live Text in photos, Visual Look Up, new animated backgrounds in Weather, on-device speech processing, and Keys in the Wallet.

Apple's [Neural Engine](https://apple.fandom.com/wiki/Neural_Engine) debuted in the iPhone X - dedicated processing power on the chip to handle AI and machine learning tasks. With the iPhone XS, Apple doubled the neural engine cores from only two up to eight - a massive leap that allowed five trillion operations per second.

This beefed-up neural engine is the reason that [every single iOS 15 feature](https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/news/new-ios-15-features-require-iphone-xs-above/ ) is supported on the XS.

### 3. It will have three more years of support

It is almost guaranteed that the iPhone XS will be supported for three more years. Why? Because Apple has never dropped support for two iPhone generations at the same time.

So, looking at [historical iOS compatibility](https://www.statista.com/chart/5824/ios-iphone-compatibility/) and taking an educated guess, the worst case scenario would be that Apple drops support for the 6S in 2022, the 7 in 2023, the 8 and X in 2024, and finally the XS and XR in 2025.

Actually what am I talking about - that's four more years of support! I'll leave a one-year buffer in there in case Apple goes for a major shake-up like dropping the 6S and 7 at the same time. But it's not inconceivable that Apple will give the XS seven years of support from 2018-2025.

What about Android, you ask? Well, the Pixel 3 also came out in 2018 and it's support [just ended](https://gizmodo.com/rip-pixel-3-1847985883). I'm just getting started.

### 4. It has the same amount of RAM as the iPhone 13

Despite looking just like the 6S, the iPhone 6 only had five years of support, which ended with iOS 12. One of the main reasons the 6S has outlasted the 6 is that the iPhone 6 only has 1 GB of RAM, whereas the iPhone 6S has 2 GB.

Each new iOS release requires more RAM to handle multitasking in the user interface and to keep everything running smoothly.

The "S" year improvements usually bump up the RAM, and the XS is no exception - the iPhone X has 3 GB of RAM, while the iPhone XS has 4 GB. Interestingly, all the newer models, including the iPhone 11, 12, and 13 also have 4 GB of RAM. Only the "Pro" models have 6GB.

So, if the amount of RAM correlates to ongoing solid performance and future software support, the XS is in a great position.

### 5. It has the first 7 nanometre (nm) chip

The number of transistors you can cram onto a chip determines how many operations per second the CPU can perform. [I talked about this at length]({{< relref "2020-10-29-the-iphone-twelves.markdown" >}}) when Apple moved to the 5 nm chip with 11.8 billion transistors. Not bad considering there was only one transistor on the latest and greatest microchip in 1952.

For reference, the latest iPhone 13 also has a 5 nm chip with 15 billion transistors and can perform 15.8 trillion operations per second.

Similar to the iPhone 12, the iPhone XS also represents an inflection point in chip evolution. With previous iPhones being based on a 10 nm process, the XS was the first smartphone in the industry to use a 7 nm chip containing 6.9 billion transistors.

This 7 nm chip, the A12 Bionic to be precise, is still being used in a lot of Apple devices, including ones that have just been released in 2021, such as the second-generation Apple TV 4K.

### 6. It's battery is not as bad as they say

### 7. It's the perfect size

### 8. It's the last premium iPhone

Up until 2017, Apple's marketing team was doing a great job at naming the iPhones. You had the iPhone 3, iPhone, 4, iPhone 5, iPhone 6, iPhone 7, etc. with the "S" years slotted in between consistently.

Then they shipped the iPhone 8 along with the iPhone 10 and skipped the iPhone 9 entirely. Except they used Roman numerals, so it was the "iPhone X", not the "iPhone 10". Then in 2018, came the XS and XR. Nobody knew what the "R" stood for, but it was cheaper and less-premium than the XS. Then in 2019, they turned the XR into the iPhone 11 and split off the premium iPhone into a new "Pro" line.

So you see - or maybe you don't and I don't blame you - somewhere in that ghastly time period where the marketing guys were losing their minds, they pulled a switcheroo.

It used to be that there was only one iPhone and it was the very best iPhone. Now the Pro iPhones have muddied the waters and made the regular iPhones seem inferior. But the iPhone XS was the last premium "iPhone", and it was the best iPhone, and I like that.

### 9. It's better than the XR for the same price

### 10. It's over $1000 cheaper than it used to be

NOTES:

* On the second-hand market, they are priced the same as XR, but are much more premium with stainless steel frame, OLED screen, small bezels, two cameras, etc.
* The discount is huge. Originally cost $1544 CAD after tax, but around $400 now, so over a thousand bucks cheaper. [https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/09/12/iphone-xs-max-iphone-xr-canadian-specs-pricing-availability/](https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/09/12/iphone-xs-max-iphone-xr-canadian-specs-pricing-availability/ "https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/09/12/iphone-xs-max-iphone-xr-canadian-specs-pricing-availability/")
* It is the same width as the iPhone 13 Pro, which is sleeker and nicer in the hand than the wider iPhone XR and 11. [https://www.hotspot3d.com/#compare/apple-iphone-xs-silver/apple-iphone-13-pro-silver](https://www.hotspot3d.com/#compare/apple-iphone-xs-silver/apple-iphone-13-pro-silver "https://www.hotspot3d.com/#compare/apple-iphone-xs-silver/apple-iphone-13-pro-silver")
* It has 4GB of RAM which is twice as much as the 6S and one more than the iPhone X, which had 3GB. I believe this will make a difference for future iOS support where the iPhone 6 was cut off early because it only had 1GB of RAM. Also, need to verify, but I heard all the base models of iPhone up to the 13 have 4GB RAM.
* First 7 nanometer chip! And better neural engine - hence full support for iOS 15.
* Battery only has moderate improvement, but the XS does have fast charge capability (50% charge in 30 minutes).

A bit dramatic, but could use this article in the post:

[https://www.phonearena.com/news/Upgrading-your-phone-could-cost-you-your-retirement_id135906](https://www.phonearena.com/news/Upgrading-your-phone-could-cost-you-your-retirement_id135906 "https://www.phonearena.com/news/Upgrading-your-phone-could-cost-you-your-retirement_id135906")

I like the premium, understated design of the XS - as affirmation, take a look at the direction Android is going: ...... what's up with these terrible design choices - the Pixel 6 takes the camera bump to the next level.
