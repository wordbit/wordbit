I was pretty excited when [I found out]({{< relref "2021-06-18-how-are-you-still-alive.markdown" >}}) my iPhone 6S would get an incredible of seven years of software support (up to at least the end of 2022). In fact, if you're a regular reader of this blog, you're probably sick of me crowing about how my 6S marches on when Android equivalents lie long dead in the grave.

Which is why I feel terrible about this.

6S, I'm ditching you.

Actually, I don't feel that terrible. I guess I could stick it out it until the bitter end, but the truth is that the end-of-life stage is never pretty. The performance of my 6S is really choking, especially when it comes to the shutter speed on the camera. It's a familiar sign of old age - when it takes a few seconds to snap one picture, you know the end is near.

The battery life is even worse, as to be expected on the second-thinnest iPhone ever made (the iPhone 6 is the thinnest). I'm used to plugging in my 6S every couple of hours, but that's no way to live.

Admittedly, this drop in performance is typical of any new iOS version, which typically gets a lot better after a few iterations - iOS 15 is no exception. But man, I just can't stomach the thought of spending a seventh year with the 6S - life's just too short.

So, having made that decision - what's My Next?

First off, I'm not even thinking about jumping ship to Android. I'm not only deeply entrenched in the Apple ecosystem, but am also not enthused by the latest Android flagships.

Out of all the current offerings, I think Google Pixels offer the purest Android experience. But they're way too big and the massive "camera visor" tacked onto the back is atrocious. Google has guaranteed software support for three years, but... well, I think you know how I feel about that. Piddling.

On the other hand, I'm not excited about the latest-and-greatest iPhone 13 either. ........................There's no way I'm dropping over a grand
