I was pretty excited when [I found out]({{< relref "2021-06-18-how-are-you-still-alive.markdown" >}}) my iPhone 6S would get an incredible of seven years of software support with iOS 15 (up to at least the end of 2022). In fact, if you're a regular reader of this blog, you're probably sick of me crowing about how my 6S marches on when Android equivalents lie long dead in the grave.

Which is why I feel terrible about this.

6S, I'm ditching you.

Actually, I don't feel that terrible. I guess I could have stuck out it until the bitter end next year, but the truth is that the end-of-life stage is never pretty. The performance of my 6S was really choking, especially when it came to the shutter speed on the camera. It's a familiar sign of old age - when it takes a few seconds to snap one picture, you know the end is near.

The battery life was even worse, as to be expected on the second-thinnest iPhone ever made (the iPhone 6 is the thinnest). I got used to plugging in my 6S every couple of hours, but that's no way to live.

Admittedly, this drop in performance is typical of any new iOS version, which typically gets a lot better after a few iterations. But man, I just couldn't stomach the thought of spending a seventh year with the 6S - life's just too short. The seven-year itch is real, y'all.

.............................Having come to a decision to move on, I also realized that the latest and greatest iPhone 13 just isn't for me.
