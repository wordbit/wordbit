[![doctrainwest](http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/doctrainwest.jpg)](http://www.doctrain.com/west/) I won a ticket to this year's [DocTrain West](http://www.doctrain.com/west/) conference through the [Westcoast STC](http://www.stcwestcoast.ca/index.php)! I'd like to thank the organizer Scott Abel and the good people at the STC for giving me this terrific opportunity. As I mentioned before, if you can afford the $899, or have a generous employer, then be there or don't-be-square.
