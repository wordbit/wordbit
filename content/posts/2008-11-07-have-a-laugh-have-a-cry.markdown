Here are some recent article shorts. As usual, you can click on the thumbnails to read them. The one on the left is a feel-good piece on laughter yoga. The right piece touches on the depressing psychological and cultural effects of global warming. There's also a teeny one in there on the dodgy air we have to breathe in airplanes (even Purell won't save you this time).

Seeing these two articles juxtaposed like this evokes a stark contrast between Western frivolity and Aboriginal reality. Note how they're both sitting in the same cross-legged position too. I almost wish the art department had actually planned it that way.
