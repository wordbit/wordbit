Well, to inspire me to write more, I've registered the domain name [antoineg.info](http://antoineg.info) for this blog. I'm hoping to use it for anything and everything and the default address was such a mouthful. So, why not? I used godaddy and only paid $2 for the year (they had a special on .info domains). I can always cancel it later but still keep the blog. Not bad at all.
