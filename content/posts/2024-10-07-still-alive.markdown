Yes, I'm still alive - just working on some other writing projects! Thought I'd better check in after my last post where it sounded like I was dying.

I guess I am still dying - we all are - just more slowly.

What did I miss? The summer months of July and August zipped by before I could catch a tan. We camped at Ellison Provincial Park on Okanagan Lake for one of our trips. On another, we explored the northern part of Vancouver Island, including a stay on Malcolm Island, a Finnish colony.

In September, there was a dull iPhone 16 event that wasn't even worth writing about.

And that brings us to October, which means we're all caught up!

But I can't resist leaving you with a little something...
