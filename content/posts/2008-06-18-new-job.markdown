[![vtlogo](http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/vtlogo.gif)](http://shop.vtechcanada.com/vtt/en/?) I've just signed a 6-month contract with [Vtech](http://shop.vtechcanada.com/vtt/en/?) to work as a technical writer in their engineering department! As you probably know, Vtech primarily designs and manufactures cordless phones as well as other wireless devices. 

The company usually outsources their documentation to the States. Presently, however, they're developing a completely new product line (sorry, I can't say what it is) and need a writer in-house. This is a new position, so the challenge for me will be in ensuring that I get the information I need from the engineers without taking too much time away from their primary tasks. There are other challenges which I won't get into, suffice to say I'll be involved in some hardcore digital asset management and interface design... 

If the position works out, I could get a permanent position down the road. Anyway, It's exactly what I've been looking for, so I'm excited to start next week!
