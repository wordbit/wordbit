At Google I/O ten years ago Sergey Brin went on a Google Hangout with a gang of daredevil skydivers wearing Google Glass. The demo was messy, chaotic and infused with pure hubris.

And although both Google Hangouts and Glass are now discontinued, the 2012 Google I/O is still the most memorable one in hindsight.

This year's I/O felt very similar to ones from the last few years - measured, academic, and forgetful.
