At Google I/O ten years ago Sergey Brin dropped into a Google Hangout with a gang of daredevil skydivers wearing Google Glass. The demo was messy, chaotic and infused with pure hubris.

Both Google Hangouts and Glass are now discontinued. But the 2012 Google I/O is still the most memorable one, if only for its overreaching ambition.

This year's I/O felt very similar to ones from the last few years - measured, academic, and forgetful. It was only at the end when a glimmer of excitement made me sit up straighter in my chair.

Google Glass had returned.

Well... not exactly, but close. The ever-respectable and approachable Sundar Pichai, waxing on about the possibilities of AR, [dropped a video](https://youtu.be/lj0bFX9HXeE) showing a prototype of smart glasses stripped of everything - including the "glasshole" camera  - that only performed one function: real-time language translation.

Google is onto something here. Single-purpose gadgets can become great products precisely because they are born out of constraint to become focused tools. It's the natural evolution of product design that precedes the all-purpose "one device". You simply cannot converge into a compelling device that "does everything" before the technology is ready.

I only hope that Google stays the course with this - not unlike many other dreamers I know, they're just really bad at finishing what they started.

Watching the I/O livestream, it was good to see in-person events happening again. There's something about audience applause that validates what the presenter is saying. Without it, the presentation feels more like an infomercial where the presenter can say any bonkers thing and get away with it.

I wish I could tell you that the audience alone gave I/O the energy it needs, but it's hard to get excited about announcements such as "24 new languages added to Google Translate". Add the inevitable "we made YouTube better" (auto-generated chapters), "we made Google Maps better" (Immersive View), "we made Google Docs better" (automated summaries), and "we made Google Search better" (Scene Exploration).

Most of the improvements flex Google's AI muscle and are... nice. Nice, but not mind-blowing.

PLAN: ...................DALL E stuff, move through AI discussion, then onto hardware at end, followed by iPhone HW.

Talk about DALL E 2 and how it is the most impressive implementation of AI right now - See subreddit for samples: [https://www.reddit.com/r/dalle2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dalle2/ "https://www.reddit.com/r/dalle2/")
