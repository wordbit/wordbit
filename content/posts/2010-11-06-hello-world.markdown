This is a personal blog. Having read that sentence, you might be inclined to click away in disgust. I won't blame you. In fact, I hope that is exactly what you do. I'm not really writing this stuff for your enjoyment - it's more for mine. But, if you stick around, I won't tell you to fuck off. I mean, it's not like I'm some sort of misanthrope or something. I just want you to know that this could be mind-numbingly boring for you. It could be trivial and a waste of your precious time. It could be all you read is about what I ate for breakfast or how crap the traffic is, or an inane exploration of some minutia that wouldn't even tickle your grandma's fancy. As long as I know that and you know that, then we're cool.
