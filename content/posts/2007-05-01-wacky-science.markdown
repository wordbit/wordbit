![](http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/WindowsLiveWriter/Wackyscience_131AC/ali2%5B9%5D.jpg)Can governments read people's minds with radio waves? Many people believe so. In fact, in order to combat this unseen menace, a paranoid subculture has arisen around the wearing of tin foil hats. This seemingly bizarre practice has garnered such credibility that [an MIT student conducted empirical research](http://people.csail.mit.edu/rahimi/helmet/) in order to debunk it. Curiously, his findings indicated that tin foil in fact _amplifies_ certain radio frequencies. Ironically, or perhaps tellingly, the frequencies amplified are the very same governmental and corporate frequencies that paranoids are trying to avoid.

If you can't get enough of tin foil technology, check out this [incredibly detailed website](http://zapatopi.net/afdb/), which includes links to a book on amazon.com as well as [PDF instructions](http://zapatopi.net/afdb/afdbdiagram.pdf) on how to build your own aluminum foil deflector beanie.
