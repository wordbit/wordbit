Well, here’s my contribution to the let’s - take - a - picture - of - the - scene - from - my - bedroom - window collection of Vancouver weather pictures. Not many people are willing to actually go outside and take a few shots. I don’t blame them. Heck, I can’t even go outside without jumping over the fence because the front gate is frozen shut. It’s no joke. Do you have any idea how dodgy it looks when I have to scramble over the fence everyday to get to school?

Here’s a view of my lonely car from my icicle prison:
