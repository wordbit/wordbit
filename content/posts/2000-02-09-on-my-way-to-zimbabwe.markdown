*On the bus to Zimbabwe…*

I’m glad I took the Greyhound, the scenery from Johannesburg through the Northern province is incredible. Been experiencing some heavy rains. 

Yesterday, I went to Rosebank and watched *Xiu Xiu: The Sent Down Girl*; Possibly the most depressing movie I’ve ever seen.

Colleen and Chris have been most hospitable - Chris is a really great guy. Sabrina is a real sweetheart, for lack of a better word - she’s so beautiful.

Near the border now, travelling through the area with great Baobabs.

Going to be two hours late. Couldn’t get through to the youth hostel; hope they’re still open at 9.
