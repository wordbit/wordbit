I haven't had anything published in a while! Here is an article I wrote entitled "Unlearning Racism" and it deals with growing up in South Africa. This is something my S.A. friends might find interesting, although I hope you guys from "die moederland" will appreciate it was written for a North American audience. It was published in a magazine entitled "Think Equity" which is distributed on the U.B.C. campus; there is a [PDF version](http://students.ubc.ca/access/download/ThinkEquity2-2.pdf) available on-line, if you're interested follow the link and check out page 4.
