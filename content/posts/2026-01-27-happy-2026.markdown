In reflecting back on last year, I feel nothing but gratitude. 2025 was awesome. We saw some spectacular shows, including the *Pixies* and *The Lion King*. We explored colourful parts of Mexico we hadn't been to before, including Guadalajara, San Miguel de Allende, and San Pancho. These experiences make vibrant memories that stand out in stark contrast from the grey routines of daily life.

Daily life. It's boring to write about, but not all bad. I work full time, do chores on weekends, try to work out more, and try to eat better (queue that *Radiohead* song: fitter, happier, more productive). Typical New Year's Resolution stuff, but I am turning 50 this year, so staving off the inevitable decline has been on my mind. I'm not perfect and I have plenty of bad days to balance out the good. But I made it to a new year and if you're reading this, so did you! Happy 2026.
