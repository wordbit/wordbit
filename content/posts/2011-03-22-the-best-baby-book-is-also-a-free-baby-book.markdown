We've checked out _What To Expect When You're Expecting_, and it's ok, albeit a little on the alarmist side. But it turns out, one of the most straightforward and well laid out books is the one published by Health Canada. Unfortunately, they stopped sending new parents the hard copy, but you can [download the PDF here](http://www.health.gov.bc.ca/library/publications/year/2010/bbc.pdf). This book also includes lots of illustrations of useful positions for when mom goes into labour.
