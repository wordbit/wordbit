[![logo](http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/logo.gif)](http://www.bookmarksmagazine.com/) I've been looking around for a book review website that aggregates all the critic reviews, sort of like [Rotten tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com) does with movies. The best I could find was the website for [Bookmarks Magazine](http://www.bookmarksmagazine.com/). They add up reviews from most major US newspapers to give a book a rating out of five stars. It's a handy way to see if a book will make it past your discerning taste radar and sneak its way onto your bedside table. 

Of course you could always browse on Amazon or check out the [New York Times book review](http://www.nytimes.com/pages/books/), which most book junkies religiously follow.
