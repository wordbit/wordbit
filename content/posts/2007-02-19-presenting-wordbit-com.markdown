I am proud to unveil my new website, [wordbit.com](http://www.wordbit.com/) - my latest blog effort using everything I’ve learned here to improve the user experience. I haven’t launched a full-scale marketing campaign yet, so I’m inviting whatever phantom readers I have here to check it out and comment on it. Now, it’s not entirely done yet, but feedback would be great.

Here are some great reasons to switch to wordbit.com:



* The URL is so much shorter and easier to remember.

	
* wordbit.com has a clean look, with lots of white space and larger fonts.

	
* Randomly generated banner images…cool!

	
* There are a minimum of cumbersome graphics - should be fast loading.

	
* There is a resource section for technical writers that you can help build.

	
* Focused content and well-written edited posts with substance and a minimum of fluff.

	
* If you like what you read here, switch to wordbit.com and stay in touch!



Check it out!
