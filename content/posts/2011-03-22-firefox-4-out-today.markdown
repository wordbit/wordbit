I pretty much use Firefox exclusively, especially on a windows machine. The one-two punch of the NoScript and Adblock extensions definitely curbs viruses and spyware. So far, I'm liking the new version - the interface is pretty slick, but I'm not seeing massive speed gains. It's certainly not 6x faster as claimed. But, shiny new releases are always good.
