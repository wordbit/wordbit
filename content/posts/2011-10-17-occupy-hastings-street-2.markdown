The world's top 1 percent of wealthy people are being discriminated  against! Let's band together and fight for the rights of wealthy  citizens without whose economic and philanthropic contributions, the  world will be a poorer place.




The fact of the matter is, not everybody on this planet can live  in a mansion, drive a Ferrari, and eat caviar every night. The world's  resources are finite and such a lavish lifestyle is unsustainable. So  why begrudge the rich for being stewards of our limited resources? Due  to their hard work or inheritance, these people have been given the  arduous task of managing vast financial empires that reach into every  aspect of our lives. Do the sheep begrudge the shepherds? No! Nor should  those who live lives that are nasty, brutish and short discriminate out  of feelings of fear and envy.




This is a call for the wealthy to band together and occupy the  poorest neighbourhoods in Vancouver. We plan for a march through the  Downtown Eastside and a peaceful occupation of tent cities where the  non-tax-paying homeless languish with idle hands.




If you are in the top 1 percent, contact me to discuss where to  send your financial contribution to this worthy cause! With your  considerable fund-raising clout, we can be sure to raise more than  enough to generate a marketing campaign and spark a new social movement  to counter the rampant discrimination souring the reputation of the  world's most noble citizens.
