I think I'll give Posterous a try. Seems like an easy way to blog from anywhere. Who knows, I may actually keep this going if it goes well. Microblogging seems the way to go these days. I checked out Tumblr, but I'm liking Posterous better so far. Of course, I still have my regular blog on [wordbit.com](http://wordbit.com), but Wordpress is not as easy to update on the fly. Besides, I really need something more personal.
