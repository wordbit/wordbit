As 2010 hits in full force I'm thinking of ways to schedule in more quality blog time and keep wordbit alive. In the meantime, [here is my latest article](http://www.alive.com/health/avoiding-cold-flu-germs/) on how to avoid cold and flu germs.

So it's apt then that my article recommends borderline conspiracy theory-fueled paranoid behaviour to avoid catching a sniffle.
