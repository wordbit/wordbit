How do you know I'm real?

I didn't think we'd get here so quickly. ChatGPT has revealed itself as the uncanny villain to writers everywhere. Writing on any generic topic has become meaningless overnight, because the AI can probably do it better.

So, I ask you again, how do you know I'm real?

Well, when I was in first grade, I threw up on a girl in reading circle and made her cry. Also, I hate eating raw onions and cooked apple pie. Trust me - I'm human.

But isn't that what an AI would say to convince you it's human? ðŸ¤”

People have been using ChatGPT to write everything from college essays, to legal documents (saving them thousands of dollars no doubt), to their wedding vows (come on dude, so not worth it). ChatGPT can even write pretty good code.

I can promise you, however, that I have no plans to hand off my writing duties to an AI anytime soon and will never even try the in-vogue party trick of asking ChatGPT to write a post and pass it off as my own writing.

There are of course problems with ChatGPT, the most troubling being that it states facts so confidently, you'd assume those facts are true (they are often not). Don't believe what you read, indeed.

Currently, OpenAI is burning three million dollars a day by giving the public access to ChatGPT. It's only a matter of time, then, before the genie is stuffed back into the bottle.

But, you can't kill a genie. What will happen a decade from now when that cost comes down and most of the written word on the internet is AI-generated?

Capitalism is all about saving money to make more money. Companies will default to the cheapest option by automating marketing and informational content instead of hiring writers.

Let me be frank - most marketing and informational content is pure bullshit. It's just a tragedy that because humans have been trying so hard to write like robots, the robots will eventually take over.

But it won't stop there - it is all too easy for an AI to analyze your tweets or reddit posts and imitate a credible social media presence on your behalf.

In the future, it will become impossible to find a real person on the internet. It's ironic - the internet was created to bolster communication, only to have it become an automated parody of communication. Since AI basically uses all the writing on the Internet for it's training data, the internet will become a snake eating it's own tail.

Maybe this is how skynet starts, or maybe I'm being overly pessimistic. I asked ChatGPT to weigh on on whether AI will take over writer jobs in the future, and it humbly deferred to human creativity with just the right touch of humility.
