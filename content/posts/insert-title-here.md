I was starting to wonder if I'm the only human on planet Earth who still writes blog posts anymore. I'm not going to lie - now that social media is entrenched into the fabric of the 21st century, blog posts seem retro and anachronistic - even to an old man like me.

And then I came across Matt Gemmell's [brilliant insight](https://mattgemmell.com/content-creation/) on the rhetoric of writing in these dark times, giving much-needed context to my thoughts. He's right - words matter. Gemmell sees "a worrying trend towards trivialisation amongst those who make things on their own".

He points out that the word "blog" has "connotations of the ramblings of some random person, without authority or polish".

And here is his take on the word "post", which is not as seemly as the word "article":

> It focuses on the mechanic of putting-up, making the actual published material almost irrelevant. It’s an emission; it’s another chunk. That’s minimising, and trivialising. It’s insulting.

Gemmell brings it home by calling out "content" as the most hideous word out there: "content is fungible, space-filling, placeholder-replacing _stuff_, and that’s not even its most offensive connotation," he argues.

Read the rest of his piece to see how the offense escalates.

So, perhaps I won't call my longform pieces "blog posts" anymore. To counterbalance the insidious narrative, writers need to re-frame what we do. If blogging is dead, then it is us who should wield the knife.

And needless to say, I'll be calling myself a "writer" until the day I die - never a "content creator". It's no wonder that such a demeaning job title asks for so little pay. It really is depressing how far the monetary value of the written word has plummeted. And how so many writers are complicit because they have been beaten into submission and have lost all confidence in their craft and talents.

Humans thrive on creativity. Molding something beautiful out of chaos isn't easy, but creation is the breath of life. Breath is movement, a wind that brings change and growth and joy at the breaking of the doldrums. Whatever creative space you inhabit, your ultimate goal should be to evolve from creator to artist.

The distinction is subtle, but spiritually significant. Creators are trapped in a fruitless cycle of appeasement trying to hold an audience. Artists don't care about an audience - they only try to please themselves. One has integrity, the other does not. Choose wisely.

Social media is anathema to a true artist. But it is now the dominant form of cultural expression in our society. User-generated "content" is completely lacking in artistry, yet so many are pulled into both the sordid and trivial minutiae of people's lives.

This concept isn't new. Reality TV paved the way - cheap and exploitative, from the _Jerry Springer Show_ to _America's Funniest Home Videos_, voyeuristic forays into peoples lives has always been around, but at least it used to be on the fringe.

Now there are those who are so deeply submerged in social media that, instead of harmless entertainment, they consider it a credible source of news and journalism. How far we have fallen.

As if this situation wasn't weird enough, Elon Musk actually bought Twitter this week (for the bargain price of 44 Billion Dollars). So, now both Facebook and Twitter are owned by cults of personality - the egomaniacs Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk who are both, ironically, the most socially-awkward men on the planet.

Oh man, Facebook, WTF. If Facebook's big bet on the future of VR and AR (now rebranded as "Meta" to avoid all the negative connotations of the Facebook brand) doesn't have you alarmed, it soon will. They're developing a wrist-mounted electromyography device that you can train to sense the signals you're sending from your brain to your hands. So, basically you can manipulate virtual objects with your mind - absolutely bonkers.

Why aren't other players investing as heavily in AR/VR Research and Development? 

Mark is gunning so hard to own "the metaverse", you have to wonder if he knows something we don't. Twenty years ago, I tried _Second Life_ for a few minutes and that scared me off social VR for life. Are people really going to surrender their souls at the gate to Facebook's virtual world? Given the current state of the world, perhaps I shouldn't be surprised if they do.

Are you a creator or an artist?

How do you define yourself?

Facebook: Meta and its "mind-reading" tech

Social media and it's "content" now owned by cults of personality.

But all I really want to know is... what happened to Julie Truscott? I like to think she is secretly living a fabulous life out there somewhere, not dead.

A lot of the people I went to High School with are on Facebook. But not all...
