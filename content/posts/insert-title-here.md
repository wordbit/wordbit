Welcome to this month's random musings on the internet! I'm starting to wonder if I'm the only human on planet Earth who still writes unpaid blog posts anymore. I'm not going to lie - now that social media is entrenched into the fabric of the 21st century, blog posts seem retro and anachronistic - even to an old man like me.

Matt Gemmell's [brilliant insight](https://mattgemmell.com/content-creation/) on the rhetoric of writing in these dark times gives much-needed context to my feelings and vague suspicions. He's right - words matter. Gemmell sees "a worrying trend towards trivialisation amongst those who make things on their own". He points out that the word "blog" has "connotations of the ramblings of some random person, without authority or polish".

And here is his take on the word "post", which is not as seemly as the word "article":

> It focuses on the mechanic of putting-up, making the actual published material almost irrelevant. It’s an emission; it’s another chunk. That’s minimising, and trivialising. It’s insulting.

Amen Brother.

And then Gemmell brings it home by calling out "content" as the most hideous word out there: "content is fungible, space-filling, placeholder-replacing _stuff_, and that’s not even its most offensive connotation," he argues. Read the rest of his piece to see how the offense escalates.

Needless to say, I'll be calling myself a "writer" until the day I die - never a "content creator". It's no wonder that such a demeaning job title asks for so little pay. It really is depressing how far the monetary value of the written word has plummeted. And how so many writers are complicit because they have been beaten into submission and have lost all confidence in their craft and talents.

The question you have to ask yourself is: 

Are you a creator or an artist?

How do you define yourself?
