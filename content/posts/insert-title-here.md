I was starting to wonder if I'm the only human on planet Earth who still writes blog posts anymore. I'm not going to lie - now that social media is entrenched into the fabric of the 21st century, blog posts seem retro and anachronistic - even to an old man like me.

And then I came across Matt Gemmell's [brilliant insight](https://mattgemmell.com/content-creation/) on the rhetoric of writing in these dark times, giving much-needed context to my thoughts. He's right - words matter. Gemmell sees "a worrying trend towards trivialisation amongst those who make things on their own".

He points out that the word "blog" has "connotations of the ramblings of some random person, without authority or polish".

And here is his take on the word "post", which is not as seemly as the word "article":

> It focuses on the mechanic of putting-up, making the actual published material almost irrelevant. It’s an emission; it’s another chunk. That’s minimising, and trivialising. It’s insulting.

Gemmell brings it home by calling out "content" as the most hideous word out there: "content is fungible, space-filling, placeholder-replacing _stuff_, and that’s not even its most offensive connotation," he argues.

Read the rest of his piece to see how the offense escalates.

So, perhaps I won't call my longform pieces "blog posts" anymore. To counterbalance the insidious narrative, writers need to re-frame what we do. If blogging is dead, then it is us who should wield the knife.

And needless to say, I'll be calling myself a "writer" until the day I die - never a "content creator". It's no wonder that such a demeaning job title asks for so little pay. It really is depressing how far the monetary value of the written word has plummeted. And how so many writers are complicit because they have been beaten into submission and have lost all confidence in their craft and talents.

The question you have to ask yourself is:

Are you a creator or an artist?

How do you define yourself?

Social media discussion ->

Facebook: Meta and its "mind-reading" tech

Twitter: Bought by Elon Musk

Social media and it's "content" now owned by cults of personality.

But all I really want to know is... what happened to Julie Truscott? I like to think she is secretly living a fabulous life out there somewhere, not dead.

A lot of the people I went to High School with are on Facebook. But not all...
