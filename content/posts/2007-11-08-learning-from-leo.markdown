![LeonardodaVinci](http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/LeonardodaVinci.jpg) Peter Legge, CEO of Canada Wide (the behemoth that publishes just about every magazine in Western Canada), recently wrote a little book on how to jump-start your career. 

He advises us to model ourselves after Leonardo da Vinci, who believed that seven key elements allowed him to become one of the most incredible innovators of our time. Here they are:

1. _Curiosita_: An insatiably curious approach to life and an unrelenting quest for continuous learning.

2. _Dimostrazione_: A commitment to test knowledge through experience.

3. _Sensazione_: The continual refinement of the sense, especially sight, as the means to enliven experience.

4. _Sfumato_ (literally, "Going up in smoke"): A willingness to embrace ambiguity, paradox and uncertainty.

5. _Arte/Scienza_: The development of the balance between science and art, logic and imagination. Whole-brain thinking.

6. _Corporalita_: The cultivation of grace, ambidexterity, fitness, and poise.

7. _Connessione_: A recognition of and an appreciation for the interconnectedness of all things and phenomena. Systems thinking.
