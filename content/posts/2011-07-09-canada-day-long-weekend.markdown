On the Canada Day long weekend we went camping at Conkle Lake. It was a 450km drive, the last 25km on a dirt track in the middle of nowhere. We arrived at 10:30pm and discovered the campsite was pretty much full. Luckily for us though, we managed to snag the last spot! Unluckily, as I unpacked the tent, I realized that I had forgotten the tent poles at home. Fortunately, the park ranger lent us his tent and saved us from sleeping under the stars for three nights. Good thing - because it was damn cold. It was a lovely spot and the days were nice enough, but the Monchkin was not a happy camper. She cried quite a bit in the evenings, much to the chagrin of fellow campers. And trying to protect her from the mosquitoes, campfire smoke, frigid nights, and scorching sun was a lot of work. So, I think we'll wait until she's a bit older before roughing it again. Anyway, it all ended well but the parents are older and wiser. Especially silly daddy who forgot the tent poles.
