What starts out as a Christmas Eve trip to the mall ends up as an exercise in terror for suburban mom Della Myers (Kim Basinger) when she finds herself stranded in a forest and pursued by a quartet of thugs -- all because she's left an angry note on their car. The baddies (including Lukas Haas) chase her from the mall, and when she crashes her car in a wooded area, she has nothing to fend off her attackers but her wits and her toolbox.

From director Zhang Ke Jia comes this drama about changing times in Chengdu, China, where state-owned factory 420 is closed by the government to make way for a high-end apartment complex called 24 City. The film tells the story through the lens of several distinctive characters, from factory workers to executives to the newly monied, who are all affected in different ways by the newfound dynamism and economic growth of their nation.

Love is the central theme in this collection of three stories set in different years -- 1911, 1966 and 2005. In the first tale, a man leaves his true love to serve in the army. When he returns, he finds that his girlfriend has disappeared, so he sets out to find her. A man develops an unlikely bond with two women in the second tale; and four Taipei teens relieve their angst with technology and sex in the last story. Shu Qi and Chang Chen star.

Director Steven Soderbergh recounts the events of the Cuban revolution, in which Guevara, Fidel Castro (Demi√†n Bichir), Tamara Bunke (Franka Potente) and other revolutionaries worked to overthrow the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista.
