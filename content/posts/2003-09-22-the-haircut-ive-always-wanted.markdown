The title says it all, I've just gotten an ace haircut, and the best thing was I did it without any help! The dude actually spoke a smattering of English and cut up a storm. I was so pleased that I wanted to take him out for a beer afterwards (If I seem overly enthusiastic, then may I refer you to the entry of Wednesday, June 18th). There was the usual complement of attractive assistants standing to attention at my side. This time one of them actually helped out by holding my ears back so the hairdresser could reach those awkward spots.
