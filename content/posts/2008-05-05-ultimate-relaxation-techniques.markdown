The May edition of _alive_ magazine is out, and I have two articles published in it this month. A few months ago I interviewed stress guru [Eli Bay](http://www.elibay.com) about his relaxation techniques. Take a deep breath, relax for a few minutes and [read his insights](http://wordbit.freehostia.com/scans/EBayInterview.html).

I also wrote a short piece on [the rise of the mosquito population](http://wordbit.freehostia.com/scans/Mosquito%20article.html) in our new era of rising temperatures. Mosquitoes love warm, moist climates, and they're getting a lot of that these days.

For most of the rest of this week, I expect to be blogging exclusively on DocTrain West, which I'm attending this week.
