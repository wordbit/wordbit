Answer: None of the above.




Back when the Kindle came out in 2007, it cost $400 and [I didn't think anyone would want one](http://wordbit.freehostia.com/amazons-paperless-utopia/). But these days, a Kindle starts at $79 and is highly affordable. There are also more options to choose from.




If you've been buying e-books from Amazon, then you're pretty much locked into their ecosystem. You may be wondering if it's worth upgrading to one of the new kindles. Or perhaps you're thinking about exchanging your crap Christmas present for one. Either way, let me tell you straight up: The best kindle is what is now known as the **Kindle Keyboard 3G**. Yes, that's the Kindle 3 that came out over a year ago. Why? Well, let me tell you why the other ones suck:




**Kindle:** Without a physical keyboard, searching the store or browsing through books has become a major hassle.




**Kindle Touch / Kindle Touch 3G:** The bezel is far too small to grip comfortably. And without the extra space at the bottom, accidental page turns are frustrating.




**Kindle Fire:** No e-ink! You can't read books in sunlight and the LCD screen is harder on the eyes. The Fire fails as a dedicated e-book reader.




With e-ink, a wider bezel, a physical keyboard, and physical hard keys for page turns, the Kindle Keyboard 3G is by far the best kindle you can buy today.
