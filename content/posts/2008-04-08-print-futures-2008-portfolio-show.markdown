Come and support the grads of the Print Futures program at [our portfolio show](http://www.douglas.bc.ca/programs/print-futures/special-events/portfolio-show.html) this Thursday from 4:30pm to 7:30pm. You can drop in or stay for the whole event. 

There'll be free food, free music, and free conversation with some of the most talented writers this side of the Fraser River. The booze you'll have to pay for.
