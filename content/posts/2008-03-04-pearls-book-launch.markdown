On Friday I had the pleasure of attending the 27th Pearls book launch, the annual anthology of creative writing works by Douglas College students. My story, [The Reluctant Teacher](/images/the-reluctant-teacher.pdf), was published in it this year. I've had some poetry published in Pearls before, but that was about 8 years ago, so it's been a while. A few of the authors read by candlelight and I got to see a few familiar faces. Good times.
