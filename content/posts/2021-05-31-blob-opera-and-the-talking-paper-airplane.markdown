I don't know what Google has been smoking, but Google I/O this year was trippy.

It started out with a bunch of colourful, psychedelic slug-like blobs singing opera. Whether a machine-learning experiment or an acid trip, the effect was the same. We were also treated to a bizarre AI-generated conversation with an anthropomorphized Pluto and... a talking paper airplane.

And just when you thought your head would explode after picturing error-corrected logical qubits wrapped up in a Bob Ross painting, Google brought back all the gross greens and oranges back from the 70s for Android's "new" UI design.

It was a wild, heady, exhausting ride. But now that the I/O-induced haze has dissipated, there are a few interesting nuggets and tidbits I'd like to talk about.

* Google I/O pre-show: Blob Opera - WTF! Wierdest shit I’ve ever seen. Some sort of machine-learning experiment slash acid trip
* Somber Pichai after that - his home country of India is being hard hit right now
* Nice Google Maps update - safer routing and fuel-efficient routes
* Smart Canvas: Some sort of Microsoft Teams competitor? Live translations - cool. “Google Workspace” coming to all.
* Pichai talks about AI advances in translation, images, and voice. LaMDA - natural language algorithm. Demo was an anthropomorphized Pluto and a paper airplane!? Impressive but weird!
* Tour of Quantum Computing facility with comedian Michael Pena. Awkward jokes - “Colder than Canada?” referring to cooled quantum environment. Milestone is error-corrected logical qubit. Okay.
* Really talked up privacy and safety. Password-free future through phone authentication. Improvements in Password Manager. “We don’t sell your personal information”, etc.
* Multitask Unified Model: AI model for search. Conversational search queries. Better image search. Google Lens has improved a lot - good for math problems. “About this result” - looks good - more transparency with search results
* Google Maps: AR navigation in Google Maps. Haven’t used it much so far. Live view looks good though - more overlays. More detailed street view, including crosswalks! Nice. More tailored maps - don’t love this. Time-based results. “Area Business”
* Shopping Graph - mmmm - can search products to buy in pics. “Your Carts” - wow, that is unsettling.
* Google Photos - “Little Patterns” - tracks objects across time. Animated photos.
* “Material You” - new UI design across all products. Looks great.
* New Android 12 UI - custom colour palettes based on wallpaper chosen. Some new fluid animations and lighting effects. Quite a big redesign. Smoother and faster - but is it iOS fast?
* “Most secure devices run on Android” - wat!
* More integration between google products - TV remote on phone, Chrome OS showing notifications from phone, etc. - really going head-to-head with Apple.
* WearOS update: Pairing up with Samsung - unifying Tizen and WearOS! Wow.
* Better colour balance in pictures for people of colour - great.
* AI medical tools
* Project Starline - some sort of 3D video chat experience. Cool
