I don't know what those Googlers have been smoking these days, but Google I/O this year was just trippy.

It started out with a bunch of colourful, psychedelic slug-like blobs singing opera. Whether a machine-learning experiment or an acid trip, the effect was the same. We were also treated to a bizarre AI-generated conversation with an anthropomorphized Pluto and... a talking paper airplane?

And just when you thought your head would explode after picturing error-corrected logical qubits wrapped up in a Bob Ross painting, Google brought back all the gross greens and oranges back from the 70s for Android's "new" UI design.

It was a wild, heady, exhausting ride. But now that the I/O-induced haze has dissipated, there are a few interesting nuggets and tidbits I'd like to talk about.

After the brash Blob Opera, it was immediately sobering to hear Pichai mourn over how hard the coronavirus is hitting his home country of India right now.

I really like Sundar Pichai - as CEO, he doesn't relish the spotlight, but he handles it well. He seems to be a level-headed, humble intellectual who doesn't rub people the wrong way. If you were to judge a company by the leader at its helm, I wouldn't blame you if the calm and reassuring Pichai let you trust Google a little more than you would otherwise.

However, one man alone can't control the inextricable push and pull of conflicting interests in a company as large and varied as Google has become.

For a deep dive into Google's culture and controversy, I recommend listening to the excellent podcast [Land of the Giants](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/land-of-the-giants/id1465767420). A recent dismaying chapter in Google's history, for instance, revolved around the firing of key members on Google's AI Ethics team - seemingly due to a research paper highlighting the downsides of AI.

And yet, despite alienating academics in the AI field, Google is forging on with AI advances in translation, images, and voice. The aforementioned talking paper airplane was a demo of LaMDA - Google's natural language algorithm built on Transformer, an open-sourced neural network architecture. The technology is impressive, but talking to a paper airplane is so deliberately benign, it borders on satire.

With other AI initiatives in simultaneous development like Google's Multitask Unified Model (MUM) - also built on Transformer - it is becoming clear that Google is positioning conversational AI as the true soul of Google. The problem is that most of us don't really understand the underlying implications of this increasingly-powerful AI, and Google is fast losing credibility with the researchers who do.

Not a good look for a company whose guiding principle was once "don't be evil" (a phrase now downplayed in their Code of Conduct).

And yet, the small practical and tangible applications of AI in Google's most-popular products are genuinely great. When Google Maps delivers a driving route that is less likely to have any sudden stops (Safe Routing), AI is saving lives. And when Google Maps also offers a driving route that may not be the fastest, but uses less gas (Fuel-Efficient Route), AI is saving your gas money and the environment.

But when Google Lens scans your photograph and tells you where you can buy those pair of shoes in the photo, the AI start to get creepy again.

I get it - the conflicting duality of trying to be helpful while also trying to sell you something is something every business struggles to balance. I think that Google overcompensates on both extremes though.

It's plain icky when Chrome will start displaying all your open shopping carts from all the sites you've visited in a new tab (if you aren't bothered by that sort of cross-site tracking, you should be).

But is it any less disturbing when Google's camera will determine that you're black and adjusts the colour balance in it's image processing accordingly? Don't get me wrong - adjusting for darker skin tones is a million times better than the whitewashing camera algorithms from some companies (LG being one). But does Google actually care, or do they desperately want you to see them as a woke and inclusive company? Or, more cynically, do they want to know your ethnicity so they can add another data point to your ad profile?

Overreaching with...

Overcompensating with...

Google Photos is dead to me and it has become cluttered and hard to navigate. Too many "creations".

Maybe have a rapid-fire bullet pint round for the rest

* Google I/O pre-show: Blob Opera - WTF! Wierdest shit I’ve ever seen. Some sort of machine-learning experiment slash acid trip
* Somber Pichai after that - his home country of India is being hard hit right now
* Nice Google Maps update - safer routing and fuel-efficient routes
* Smart Canvas: Some sort of Microsoft Teams competitor? Live translations - cool. “Google Workspace” coming to all.
* Pichai talks about AI advances in translation, images, and voice. LaMDA - natural language algorithm. Demo was an anthropomorphized Pluto and a paper airplane!? Impressive but weird!
* Tour of Quantum Computing facility with comedian Michael Pena. Awkward jokes - “Colder than Canada?” referring to cooled quantum environment. Milestone is error-corrected logical qubit. Okay.
* Really talked up privacy and safety. Password-free future through phone authentication. Improvements in Password Manager. “We don’t sell your personal information”, etc.
* Multitask Unified Model: AI model for search. Conversational search queries. Better image search. Google Lens has improved a lot - good for math problems. “About this result” - looks good - more transparency with search results
* Google Maps: AR navigation in Google Maps. Haven’t used it much so far. Live view looks good though - more overlays. More detailed street view, including crosswalks! Nice. More tailored maps - don’t love this. Time-based results. “Area Business”
* Shopping Graph - mmmm - can search products to buy in pics. “Your Carts” - wow, that is unsettling.
* Google Photos - “Little Patterns” - tracks objects across time. Animated photos.
* “Material You” - new UI design across all products. Looks great.
* New Android 12 UI - custom colour palettes based on wallpaper chosen. Some new fluid animations and lighting effects. Quite a big redesign. Smoother and faster - but is it iOS fast?
* “Most secure devices run on Android” - wat!
* More integration between google products - TV remote on phone, Chrome OS showing notifications from phone, etc. - really going head-to-head with Apple.
* WearOS update: Pairing up with Samsung - unifying Tizen and WearOS! Wow.
* Better colour balance in pictures for people of colour - great.
* AI medical tools
* Project Starline - some sort of 3D video chat experience. Cool
