If you're a wannabe iPod disciple and [the rumour of an iPod levy]({{< relref "2007-12-04-ipod-price-hike.markdown" >}}) had you on your knees praying for an intervention, your prayers have been answered. Canada's federal court told the Canadian Copyright Board they had "no authority" to impose the levy, according to this [CBC News article](http://www.cbc.ca/consumer/story/2008/01/11/levy-recorders.html?ref=rss). 

Well, this is good news indeed. I already find it cheaper to buy blank CDs in the States and would hate to cross the border to buy electronic goods as well. I'm also glad the government isn't treating us all like a bunch of mp3 pirates who are intent on downloading every Celine Dion and Bryan Adams album we can lay our thieving hands on (because we all know how much Canadian music rocks).
