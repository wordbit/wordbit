That's probably the cheesiest line I've ever written. But for some reason, the editors over at _alive_ actually seem to revel in cheese (One example is the title I'll eternally shake my head at: _G...I can't believe it's a Glycemic index_). God bless 'em though - they're a wonderful bunch. 

Anyway, here's an article I really enjoyed writing because, well, I love surfing! And so does Scott over in the art department. He took some glorious pictures in Tofino and quite simply graced my article with them. [Click here](http://www.alive.com/lifestyle/goodbye-treadmill-hello-waves/) to hit the beach dude.
