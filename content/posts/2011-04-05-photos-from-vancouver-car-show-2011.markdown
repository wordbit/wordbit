On Saturday we picked our crib up from the border without any hassles then went to out maternity photoshoot. I'll upload the pics from those later. On Sunday, we attended the Vancouver International Auto show. It was in the new convention centre this time around. Overall, I thought the show was well put together, but not quite as good as last year's. I'm not sure why. Perhaps the novelty has worn off or perhaps there were just too many people this time and the layout was a wee bit crowded. Anyway, here are some shots from the show.
