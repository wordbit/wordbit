Another year is upon us and wordbit is in its 5th year! But with sporadic posts, this site has slowly slipped into oblivion. Well, I always have good intentions, but I have decided to create another personal blog, while keeping wordbit as the "public face" of my professional life. So, my personal blog is at [antoineg.info](http://antoineg.info), but you'll need to ask me for the password to access it. If I know you, you're in! I've just gotten tired of fighting off the spammers and dealing with privacy issues and the dominance of Facebook as well. But I'm not abandoning this site by any means. I'll have some more articles to tell you about soon.
