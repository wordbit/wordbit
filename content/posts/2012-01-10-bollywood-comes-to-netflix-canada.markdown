Netflix Canada's strategy is to work the multicultural angle to make up for their poor selection of blockbuster hits. While they're a bit short on the Hollywood, they've just loaded up on the Bollywood with [about 60 new movies](http://can.whatsnewonnetflix.com/) that's sure to pique the interest of any fan of the genre. And with quirky titles like Mashaal, Dhoom, and Fraaandship, how can you go wrong?




My only niggle with this release is that they threw in a couple of Russel Peters shows in there too. I love Russel Peters, but listen up Netflix: Just because the guy is brown doesn't mean you can lump him into the Indian movie genre. You're welcome.
