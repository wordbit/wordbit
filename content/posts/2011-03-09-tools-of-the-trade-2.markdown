I work on a computer all day for my writing job - it's a plain old generic desktop with a 2.66Ghz CPU, 2.5GB of RAM and a 100GB hard drive. I have dual 19-inch monitors, which is nice. I have windows XP installed. But what I really love is the new computer I have at home. It was a birthday/Christmas gift. I made the switch to apple after being a PC/windows user my whole life.

Now I have a 27-inch iMac with a 2.8Ghz quad-core CPU, 4GB of RAM, and a 1 Terabyte hard drive. It has an ATI Radeon HD 5750 graphics card with 1GB memory. It came installed with Snow Leopard and iLife '11. I have to say it's been fantastic so far. The screen feels gigantic at first, but after a while you couldn't imagine using anything smaller. My previous screen was a paltry 17 inches.

I'm learning to play piano using the included Garageband lessons and the USB midi keyboard I also got for Christmas. I'll have to post some recordings of my progress.
