Yes, yes, I haven't been motivated to do much in this heat, and work starts up again tomorrow, oh joy of all joys. Brian had downloaded some movies from the net, so we watched those last night, they haven't come out in Korea yet which is kind of cool. _Johnny English_ was hilarious. I don't, however, recommend _Tomb Raider 2_, unless you have insomnia or some perverse desire to see Angelina Jolie pretending to be cool. Today is a write off really, I've been feeling far too lazy to do anything. Maybe I've finally started to relax, and it only took a week!
