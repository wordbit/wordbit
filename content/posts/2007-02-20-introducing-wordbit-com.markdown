I have a new website up: [Wordbit.com](http://www.wordbit.com/) is where I'm going to be doing most of my blogging from now on. It's also a place to check out my on-line portfolio and participate in building a resource page for tech writers. Or any writers really. Anyways, it's an easy name to remember, so check it out and tell me how to make it better. I'm looking forward to hearing your feedback!
