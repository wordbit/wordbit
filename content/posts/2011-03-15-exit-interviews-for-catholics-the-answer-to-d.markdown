Interesting idea. However, a qualitative approach like this one will do little to change the traditions of the church. The Catholic church moves at a glacial pace and will not change to meet the needs of an increasingly disenchanted populace. Besides, if the questionnaire is tailored to individual parishes only, then systemic, global trends cannot be identified. Also, in my experience, the church cares little for the sacrilegious opinions of those that leave the flock.
