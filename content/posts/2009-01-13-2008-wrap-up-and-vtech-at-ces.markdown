The first entry of 2009! Granted, this isn't the most updated blog in the world, but I've managed to keep wordbit going for around two years now, which is not bad. I recently tried to find the oldest blog in the world, and [this site](http://www.netfunny.com/rhf/oldest-blog.html) claims to have been blogging since 1987. But that's just their opinion - blogs in their modern incarnation haven't been around for more than about 10 years.

Well, I'd like to wrap up 2008 on a personal note and let you know what's been going on in my life - besides from recently getting engaged, which I'm really excited about. ![is9181](http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/is9181.jpg)

On the work side of things, I recently extended my contract at Vtech by another 6 months. I asked for more money, which they were happy to give me. It's been a great experience no matter what happens. I've been working primarily on a business phone system, but have also helped out with the Internal Product Specification (IPS) for an internet radio, which I quite enjoyed. This product recently made its debut at CES and was [reviewed on Engadget](http://www.engadget.com/2009/01/06/vtech-plunges-into-home-audio-market-with-is9181-wifi-radio/). It's nice to be able to finally talk about this stuff! I have one at my desk and really enjoy it - I can totally recommend this nifty little device. The guys put a lot of love into this one.
