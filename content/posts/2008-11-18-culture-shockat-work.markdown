![paper_people-](http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/paper_people-.jpg)If you're more concerned with your company culture than the size of your pay cheque, your might be interested in this Vancouver start-up. [Jiibe](http://jiibe.com/) is a user-generated service that matches your value system to a compatible company based on a questionnaire you fill out. 

I can see this site being really useful to young Millennials who care a great deal about the softer aspects of job satisfaction and are in a process of self-discovery. However, this sort of thing ("eHarmony for jobs" as one user put it) might be a bit touchy-feely for boomers. But hey, if you're unemployed you probably have time to slog through the 100+ questions and spend some pleasant self-actualization time finding out you should have been working for Tim Hortons this whole time.
