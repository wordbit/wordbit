Netflix Canada has been busy releasing tons of new stuff, so I've given up detailing every single new release. Instead, here are my top picks based on movies I've either seen and recommend (especially flicks I consider to be "classic"), or movies I want to see because I've heard or read that they are good. These are based on the last few months of new releases.
