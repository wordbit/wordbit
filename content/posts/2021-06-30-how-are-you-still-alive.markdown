The iPhone 6S just won't die.

With [confirmation at WWDC](https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523351/ios-15-iphone-6s-plus-se-compatibility) that it will be receiving iOS 15, the 6S has officially become the [longest-supported smartphone](https://youtu.be/GARFBHz51nk) of all time. With an incredible seven years of guaranteed software support, this gracefully-aging phone has been conferred the title of Living Legend.

I was fully expecting my 6S to be killed off this year. I was even making succession plans. But instead, Apple granted my phone another year of reprieve. I'm pretty happy about it, and so is the Internet - here are some Twitter reactions:

If you follow the latest tech media, podcasts, and YouTube videos, you probably think that everybody has an iPhone 12 and only technophobes, or the cash-poor, or kids on hand-me-downs, use an iPhone 6S as a daily driver. Allow me to disabuse you of that notion.

According to [statistics on the most popular iOS devices](https://www.phonearena.com/news/most-popular-active-ios-android-devices-north-america-market-report_id132703) currently used in North America, there are far more people using an iPhone 6S than an iPhone 12. Surprised? You shouldn't be - most normal people are somewhat financially responsible, it turns out.

Okay, so the 6S is the new longevity champ, and I ain't complaining. But we still need to answer the burning question in the title of this post: How are you still alive?

To answer that question, we'll have to dig a bit deeper into this year's WWDC.

I would like to say that the 6S is still alive because Apple is committed to making high-quality hardware that lasts a long time, or that they are concerned about all the e-waste generated with rapid phone upgrade cycles. And perhaps that is partly true.

* Save for later? - Yet, as iPhone 13 rumours started popping up, I wished it weren't so. The iPhone 13 (or 12S most likely, but I'll call it 13 for now), is shaping up to be more of an iterative update than a complete overhaul. That's fine - I'm not complaining, but
