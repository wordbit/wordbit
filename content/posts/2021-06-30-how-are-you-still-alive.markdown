The iPhone 6S just won't die. With [confirmation at WWDC](https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523351/ios-15-iphone-6s-plus-se-compatibility) that it will be receiving iOS 15, the 6S has officially become the [longest-supported smartphone](https://youtu.be/GARFBHz51nk) of all time. With an incredible seven years of guaranteed software support, this gracefully-aging phone has been conferred the title of Living Legend.

I was fully expecting my 6S to be killed off this year. I was even making succession plans. But instead, Apple granted my phone another year of reprieve. I'm pretty happy about it, and so is the Internet - here are some Twitter reactions:

Okay, let's dig a bit deeper into this year's WWDC to answer that burning question: How are you still alive?

<!--more-->

I would like to say that the answer to that question is that Apple is committed to making high-quality hardware that lasts a long time, or that they are concerned about all the e-waste generated with rapid phone upgrade cycles. And perhaps that is partly true.

* Save for later? - Yet, as iPhone 13 rumours started popping up, I wished it weren't so. The iPhone 13 (or 12S most likely, but I'll call it 13 for now), is shaping up to be more of an iterative update than a complete overhaul. That's fine - I'm not complaining, but
