The iPhone 6S refuses to die.

With [confirmation at WWDC](https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523351/ios-15-iphone-6s-plus-se-compatibility) that it will be receiving iOS 15, the 6S has officially become the [longest-supported smartphone](https://youtu.be/GARFBHz51nk) of all time. With an incredible seven years of guaranteed software support, this gracefully-aging phone has just been conferred the title of Living Legend.

I was fully expecting my 6S to be killed off this year. I was even making succession plans. But instead, Apple granted my phone another year of reprieve. I'm pretty happy about it, and so is the Internet - here are some Twitter reactions:

If you follow the latest tech media, podcasts, and YouTube videos, you probably think that everybody has an iPhone 12 and only technophobes, or the cash-poor, or kids on hand-me-downs, use an iPhone 6S as a daily driver. Allow me to disabuse you of that notion.

According to [statistics on the most popular iOS devices](https://www.phonearena.com/news/most-popular-active-ios-android-devices-north-america-market-report_id132703) currently used in North America, there are far more people using an iPhone 6S than an iPhone 12. Surprised? You shouldn't be - most normal people are somewhat financially responsible, it turns out.

Okay, so the 6S is the new longevity champ, and I ain't complaining. But how exactly did the 6S seize the crown?

To answer that question, we'll have to dig a bit deeper into this year's WWDC.

<!--more-->

As always, go to your favourite tech site to read an itemized list of all the WWDC updates. As you do that, you will inevitably come across all the sullen editorials complaining about how boring this year's WWDC was.

However, labelling a developer's conference as "boring" is akin to labelling a dentist's conference as "only interested in teeth". But hey, this is the Internet. If you're smart, you can safely skip the cop-out "analysis" of a green Gen-Z college graduate with an English degree and find some real journalism elsewhere.

When you take some time to analyze Apple's new tentpole features announced at dub dub, you'll almost certainly see the pattern and recognize the context.

When the freight train of COVID-19 hit hard last year, everybody started working from home. Unfortunately for Apple, with it's insular work culture and emphasis on face-to-face inter-departmental collaboration, productivity took a major hit.

I'm not implying that Apple's software engineers were kicking back, playing video games slack-mouthed and covered in Cheetos dust. I'm saying they were blindsided without the right productivity tools and not going to download Office 365 anytime soon.

So, at the height of the pandemic, they started creating those tools. And this was what we got at WWDC as a result:

* Big improvements to FaceTime: screen sharing, spatial audio, voice isolation, wide spectrum, grid view, portrait mode... and FaceTime links that work in any browser on any OS. Android friends can now join the chat! Also, a fun new feature called SharePlay that lets you watch movies, listen to music, etc. with your friends in perfect sync.
* Media and links in Messages will now be saved in a "Shared with You" section in the relevant app. Nice. You can also enable a "Focus" mode (when you are busy at work, for example) that sets a status notification in Messages.
* Assorted productivity boosters: Rich results for contacts, conversation boost on AirPods, better multitasking on iPad, Quick Notes, system-wide translation, and Shortcuts on the Mac. Apple is also playing catch-up with Google by implementing full OCR across all photos (Live Text).
* Universal Control: The ultimate ecosystem flex and by far the most-impressive demo in WWDC. Using one mouse, Craig Federighi seamlessly dragged a file from his iPad, over onto his MacBook, then over onto his iMac and dropped it into a presentation.

There were some other scattered improvements to Photos, Maps, Weather, iCloud, and Safari, but the overall productivity-at-home theme was clearly the focus this year.

......but we are moving out of the pandemic which is why it felt a bit stale ....not technically innovative so 6S could handle it ....having said that many features not available

I would like to say that the 6S is still alive only because Apple is committed to making high-quality hardware that lasts a long time, or that they are concerned about all the e-waste generated with rapid phone upgrade cycles. And I believe that is partly true.

The true

* Save for later? - Yet, as iPhone 13 rumours started popping up, I wished it weren't so. The iPhone 13 (or 12S most likely, but I'll call it 13 for now), is shaping up to be more of an iterative update than a complete overhaul. That's fine - I'm not complaining, but
