I had to share these two awesome pieces of media, even though I’m technically supposed to be stoically hacking away at my 500 page burden. First of all, Wade Davis, the popular anthropologist, spoke recently at U.B.C. Do yourself a huge favour and take a listen to [his beautiful lecture](http://www.ubc.ca/podcasts/media/mp3/2006/08112006_culturesonedge.mp3). Put it on your iPod. Listen on the bus. Listen while you work.

Secondly, somebody recommended this documentary to me a short while ago: The Yes Men. About some internet savvy activists who set up spoof sites, such as [this one](http://www.gatt.org/), a spoof site of the official [World Trade Organization home page](http://www.wto.org/). Check them out. See any differences?

Here is the documentary in it’s entirety. Break out the popcorn, this is a good one.



Well, back to work.
