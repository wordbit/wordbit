I'm thinking of resurrecting this blog so we can continue to post about Mia the monchkin....and about her baby brother / sister who is coming next month!

In case you're following, the URL has changed a few times, but is now at aprivateword.wordpress.com. I know this blog is very hard to find, but then again, all good things are!
