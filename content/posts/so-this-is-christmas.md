Before you continue reading, I should warn you that this post is a bit of a bummer. So, if you're hoping to get into the Christmas spirit, click away and have a laugh at TikTok or whatever the kids do these days.

I'll try end on a positive note, although I haven't gotten there yet obviously as I've just started writing and I don't know where I'm going with this yet. Everywhere and nowhere, most likely, is where all flows of consciousness tend to go.

So, if you're a middle-aged adult like me, you've probably come to the realization that Christmas is about shielding the horrid state of the world from your kids. It's about furtive doom scrolling bathed in the glow of the Christmas tree. It's maintaining a fantasy, crafting myth and mystery, an antidote against the literal darkest month of the year, knowing all the while it is simply a placebo.

It's exhausting. And for those in the cold, without family, food, or a place to sleep, it's absolutely the worst time of year. The best of times and the worst of times - the border between these two extremes has become very porous this year.

We've just gone through one of the worst floods in BC history, leaving a wake of destruction and misery and so many people without homes. Insurance companies, the scourge of the modern world, are exploiting every dirty loophole they can conjure up to avoid paying anyone in a flood zone.

Inflation is at an all-time high, and food costs are set to skyrocket even more in 2022. Both rent and mortgage rates will follow suit as the banks scramble to keep inflation in check. For non-essential items, ongoing supply constraints have revealed the giant cracks in our reliance on a flailing shipping network. The furniture you ordered a year ago probably still hasn't arrived.

On top of that fetid mix, sprinkle the Omicron variant on top. It's bad enough that COVID has created division, with the unvaccinated losing their jobs and the vaccinated trusting that their faith in government and big pharma is not misplaced. But now Christmas is cancelled once more, with the government enforcing never-ending restrictions and lockdowns in a (futile) effort to curb yet another variant.

The good news is that the Omicron variant, by most accounts, is far milder than previous ones. And 80 percent of British Columbians are double vaccinated.

However, once the administration starts down a path, they are compelled by the weight of bureaucracy to keep going down it. And after two years, temporary measures stop being temporary.

Regardless of whether you are on team Booster or are on team Conspiracy Theory, one thing everyone can agree on is that COVID is the biggest buzzkill since the introduction of the income tax.

The wealthiest and most privileged people in this world have long ago hardened their hearts to the world around them. But for many, even those who are physically comfortable, declining mental health is the inevitable icing on top of all this.

It's gotten so bad, that [toxic positivity](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-toxic-positivity-5093958) is a thing now.

Well, the stark truth about life is that nobody is getting out of it alive. As Gandalf wisely says, "all we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us". ### Christmas was never about the presents under the tree. Well, maybe in pagan times.

Jesus = rebirth, renewal, hope, new life, hope...etc.
