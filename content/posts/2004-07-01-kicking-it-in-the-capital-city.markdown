Well, I'm in Victoria...here for another two months while I study for my TESL. I'm not sure if I'll have much time to write in this, I guess I haven't been keeping it much up to date anyway. It's Canada day today, so tonight they'll be letting off some splendiferous and costly fireworks over the parliament buildings. It is the capital after all. And a beautiful city it is, if not a little slow (or really laid back depending on how you look at it). Lots of retired folks, enough to necessitate a sign downtown which reads "Night time is for sleeping, Day time is for resting"...if you're interested in opening up an English tea-house or a funeral parlour, this would be the place to do it. Still, with the elderly safely resting or sleeping their days away, there's plenty of room for everybody to enjoy all the trees, water and sunshine.
