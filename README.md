# Stuart's Notes

My personal blog built with [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/).

The design is a blatant copy of [Spencer Lyon's Hugo
port](https://github.com/spencerlyon2/hugo_gh_blog) of the [Jekyll
Lanyon theme](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/). Spencer has also written
an excellent Hugo tutorial [Hosting on GitHub
Pages](http://gohugo.io/tutorials/github_pages_blog/).
