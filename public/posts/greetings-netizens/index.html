          <p>Well, my parents made it back safely from South Africa and they seem to have had a good time, they came back plumper and in good spirits. This week-end Angela and I are going up to Whistler for our one year anniversary. It should be awesome. Anyways, here is the weekly poem, as promised. You didn&rsquo;t think I was going to talk about me did you? No, never!</p>

<p>The milling madness returns</p>

<p>Weariness alone taints my dreary disposition.
Manifest as the milling madness taking position
In my spiritâ€™s home; the temple of bone
Dressed in flesh, yet never hewed in stone
A malleable masterpiece, easily corrupted
A soft mess too readily sculpted</p>

<p>By those soft mad hands.</p>

<p>So it is, Defeat seldom signals an end
Dogged by malcontent, I toil to fend
Off the stubborn foe poking burgeoning holes
in my riddled temple.</p>

<p>yet, in their slow conscientious way, I know
those fingers, those ruddy bulbous digits,
Will depress my flesh with relentless
meticulousness and find my harrowed soul.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve written about &ldquo;the milling madness&rdquo; elsewhere, and this seems to be a common theme for me, it&rsquo;s the feeling you know when your body feels so very very tired and weak&hellip;it&rsquo;s paralleled here by the vulnerability of the spirit. And those &ldquo;soft mad hands&rdquo;? well&hellip;I&rsquo;m not going to enunciate anything, take it as you will.</p>

<p>chow for now</p>
