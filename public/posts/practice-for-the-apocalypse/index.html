          <p>Post-apocalyptic books such as <em>The Road</em>, or TV shows such as <em>The Walking Dead</em> give us a glimpse into the aftermath of an extinction event where only tenacious bands of humans are left to cling to survival. But what if there were simulations of such scenarios - how would a mad scramble for remaining resources actually play out?</p>

<p>With online multiplayer games such as <em>Day Z</em> and <em>Rust</em>, we can now find out. <em>Rust</em>, in particular, has dispensed with the zombie conceit and stripped the game down to bare-knuckle survival of the chop-firewood and mine-for-metal variety. Hordes of players are now thrown into a vast arena where they can either co-operate or fight for resources. It&rsquo;s basically <em>Hunger Games</em> without the rules and controlling bureaucracy. And we all know what happened in that particular dystopia: Teen sociopaths opted to knock each other off with blunt weapons rather than band together to fight the The Man.</p>

<p><em>Rust</em> pretty much confirms that these fantasies were spot on. To survive, resource-hoarding and senseless torture of the weak is the order of the day.</p>

<p>Here is <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/252490/">a quote</a> from the game&rsquo;s Steam page:</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;I love this game, I built a house around a guys house and made him my prisoner, I fed him cans of tuna and cooked chicken when it was available, and some times I would drop in spare logs of wood(when they were available). The best part. he talks to me, keeps telling me his clans going to raid my structure and save him.. I simply respond with . &ldquo;It puts the lotion on its skin, or it gets the hose again&rdquo; and by hose I mean I dump charcoal on him.Â Great game hope the servers come up soon, I think my pet may need to eat.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>And here&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/2/5/5361580/dayz-will-haunt-you#214046151">another quote</a> from an article on <em>The Verge</em>:</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Me and a bunch of my friends go around hand-cuffing others and then beating them to death with our fists or feeding them alcohol tincture or rotten food, d-do I pass as non-psycho?&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>The above quote being a response to the observation that <em>Rust</em> appears to harbour more psychopaths that other online games. He was being facetious, but you get the idea. Players who are otherwise ordinary law-abiding citizens turn into monsters when loosed in a world that supports - even encourages - amoralistic behaviour in order to stay alive.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve all seen the looting and mayhem that occurs after a natural disaster, or even during riots. Would the next step be a reprehensible form of desperation that slowly morphs into a sickening sadism? With the test results leaning toward a positive in the virtual lab of <em>Rust</em>, I hope we never have to live that reality.</p>
