          <p>A fugitive from my own inevitable doom to be sure&hellip;It&rsquo;s been a rough couple of weeks. The workload quadrupled overnight as my practicum kicked in two weeks ago. Since then I&rsquo;ve been racking my brains 24-7, trying to come up with decent lesson plans. I&rsquo;ve taken to cornering the students and desperately interviewing them&hellip;What do you want to do tomorrow? Isn&rsquo;t there anything you want to learn about? What do you find fun? Last week was particularly hellish, my mentor teacher was a notorious nazi with dragon blood in her veins. It was a beginner class, not exactly my forte, but I tried my best. Didn&rsquo;t get such a hot evaluation, but at least dragon-lady gave me some good feedback. This week I&rsquo;ve had the advanced class, which suits me better, because I&rsquo;m more &ldquo;intellectual&rdquo; whatever that means, and can engage the students in analytical thought. My evaluation is substantially better and my mentor teacher is way more laid back. Here is something I wrote about a week ago:</p>

<p>I feel like I’m being unceasingly pummeled, my disposition is bruised, I’m having blackouts. The black and blue of my mind is almost tangible, I can feel the thickness of the blood as it wells after each blow. A perpetual plane-wreck getting pushed over the edge of sanity. Sunlight is foreign and feels forbidden, yet I yearn for it…I wish I could drink in the green of the trees and the blue of the skies and get drunk on beauty. I wish the war wasn’t brought to be bear on me, it’s seems unfair that I have no comrades, no brethren to share the assault, to absorb the blows&hellip;</p>

<p>Anyways, there is light at the end of the tunnel, and then another tunnel and then another tunnel and so on as the pessimist express chugs on through this world. I guess I&rsquo;m kind of worried about finding a job. Well, all things in good time Antoine, right now I&rsquo;ll just concentrate on getting through the week.</p>
