<p>I love Netflix, but it&rsquo;s hard to tell when new movies come out and whether they&rsquo;re any good or not. So, here are the latest releases for June 1st and their Rotten Tomatoes / Flixster rating. I&rsquo;ll also be giving my top pick for the day for a movie I think is the number one worth watching out of the batch&hellip; And my top pick today is <em>Knight and Day</em>. Even though other movies got higher ratings, this looks like a fun action movie for the summer.</p>
