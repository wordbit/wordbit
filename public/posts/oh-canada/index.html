          <p>It&rsquo;s been a while. Obviously this entry marks a turning point of sorts, notably because I am no longer the <em>Hermit in the Hermit Kingdom</em>. This may not seem significant in itself, but the truth is, the hermit needed to write about his life in a foreign country, whereas I do not. I&rsquo;m back in Canada and lost in limbo once more, trying to figure out how this life of mine should go. There&rsquo;s nothing even remotely interesting or novel about being unemployed in Vancouver, a situation I was in before I left a year ago, except this time I have some money in my pocket of course. So I figure&hellip;I&rsquo;m no longer a teacher, I&rsquo;m no longer living in Asia, I&rsquo;m no longer a lot of things, but I am still a writer. So there you have it. You just can&rsquo;t keep a daunted writer down. So, whether you like it or not, here I go again!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to wrap up those last few weeks in Korea if I could, but to be honest I just couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to write about it. It was such a blur anyway. A few days before I left I had Dean showing up at Incheon airport without a cent in his pocket and sick as a dog. He&rsquo;d brought Vietnamese <em>Dong</em> over which is impossible to exchange in Korea (ironically, <em>Dong</em> is the Korean word for excrement). So anyway, I fed him, gave him some money to get around and phone Australia, and gave him a place to stay. I was more than happy to help him out but what irked me a little was that he sort of expected me to do it&hellip;he had a &ldquo;So, what are you going to buy me for dinner, mate?&rdquo; attitude. Not to mention I then had a naked (he slept naked on my floor), gamey-smelling Australian puking his guts out at four in the morning in my shoebox apartment when I had work the next day. After all that I forgot to give him his degree and he had to come back the next day to pick it up. Luckily he had secured accommodations with a Korean girl in the city, how he managed that is beyond me, his resourcefulness is to be admired.</p>

<p>After weeks of practicing <em>Snow White</em>, I was pretty sick of it, as were the children. I even started being recklessly blas√©, which led me to a falling out with one of the teachers which I quickly apologized for. No need to leave on bad terms and it was most definitely my fault. On graduation day, quite a few of the kids were absent and the rest were suffering in various degrees from hoarse throats and other stress-induced ailments. Their performance of Snow White was unsurprisingly (to my mind) half-hearted at best, although the general feeling that pervaded after the whole ceremony was not one of disappointment, but of relief. We then had a sombre lunch at Arnold&rsquo;s Dad&rsquo;s restaurant and then I said my goodbyes and jumped on a plane. It was quite sad leaving my kids and some of them wrote me the sweetest letters and gave me amazing gifts. I&rsquo;m sure they will remain crystallized in my mind, un-aging, unchanging, even though I know they&rsquo;ll grow up and forget about me in twenty years.</p>

<p>The return to the &ldquo;West&rdquo; began with the transitional plane-ride, the sterile airports, the interrogations, stripping down to your socks and being herded through various scanners, hiding nail clippers away deep down in one&rsquo;s bags. I don&rsquo;t get that. They confiscate your nail clippers and anything remotely pointy then in mid-flight they hand out hundreds of metal-pronged forks to everybody on the plane and tell you to &ldquo;enjoy your meal&rdquo;&hellip; What&rsquo;s up with that!!!</p>

<p>Back in Canada, I found myself eagerly eavesdropping on people&rsquo;s conversations (now that they were comprehensible), and starting in surprise every time a stranger greeted me. There&rsquo;s more space, and less people, less pollution and I&rsquo;m enjoying my mom&rsquo;s home-cooked meals that don&rsquo;t involve <em>kimchi</em> or anything that moves or wriggles unexpectedly. These are just banal Western conceits however; I could never be so obviously ethnocentric as to say one situation is better than another. It&rsquo;s also more boring here, you can&rsquo;t buy stuff on every corner, it takes ages to get anywhere and people are spoilt and individualistic. And nobody thinks you&rsquo;re particularly special or interesting of course. I&rsquo;m sure in time I&rsquo;ll come to miss many more things about Korea, but for now it&rsquo;s good to be back. Good to just be an average Joe. The one thing I can&rsquo;t kick is the bowing, I can&rsquo;t help bowing to everybody I come across; it must look a bit weird.</p>

<p>The next trip will be to Mexico and Costa Rica in April for a few weeks. But more about that later!</p>
