          <p>Predicting the future is not just a fun exercise for the imagination - it takes an uncanny awareness, not of where the ball is, but where it&rsquo;s going to land. Futurists have to marry emerging technologies with emerging market opportunities to come up with a future scenario that actually comes to be. Only in retrospect can we see whether these social scientists were fanciful fools or crackerjack seers with a remarkable talent for predicting the future.</p>

<p>I hugely enjoy looking back at the accuracy of past predictions, and was recently blown away by the Knight Ridder (no, not of the David Hasselhoff variety) <a href="http://youtu.be/JBEtPQDQNcI">video presentation of the tablet</a>, which pretty much nailed it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tablets will be a whole new class of computer.Â They will weigh under 2lbs; they will be totally portable; they will have a clarity of screen display comparable to ink on paper; they will be able to blend text, video, audio and graphics all together; and they will be a part of our daily lives about the turn of the century.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This prediction was made 20 years ago in 1994. The only thing they failed to do was dream bigger. They predicted that the tablet would be a &ldquo;digital newspaper&rdquo; for content consumption but didn&rsquo;t see that tablets could be used for content creation and gaming as well.</p>

<p>So, what&rsquo;s the next big thing? If I were to take an educated guess, I would say transparent displays. But not the transparent displays that crop up all the time in science fiction movies (such as <em>Iron Man</em>) as a futuristic replacement for our computer screens. These UIs look cool, but are largely impractical.</p>

<p>Where transparent displays will really take off is in situations where there is a practical value to looking at something through the glass. Think HUDs in vehicles for example. Or a refined version of google glass where the lenses are an invisible part of the design, not a clunky cyborg add-on that screams &ldquo;dork&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Imagine a smart home of the future where space is at a premium in our increasingly overpopulated cities. As square footage shrinks, mounting a 60-inch TV above the fireplace is no longer practical. But you already have large floor-to-ceiling windows that let in that wonderful natural light. With <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/17/smart-glass-light-adjusts-on-command_n_3769472.html">&ldquo;smart glass&rdquo;</a> technology, the windows can turn opaque, blocking the light. The window can then double as a TV screen.</p>

<p>Or allow the natural light to flood in with <a href="http://youtu.be/m5rlTrdF5Cs">weather and calendar apps</a> overlaying your beautiful view of the mountains. Don&rsquo;t have a view? The smart window can create one for you. By switching the focus from the TV to the window, the furniture can be arranged with the window as the centrepiece, creating a harmonious <em>Feng Shui</em>, if you will, balancing the light and beauty of the outside with the ubiquitous screen that everyone now relies on for information and entertainment.</p>

<p>The technology for transparent displays is out there already, albeit in a crude form. So is the market for screens that are smarter and integrated into our everyday objects. Furthermore, transparent UIs are now a staple in our sci-fi imaginings of the future. It&rsquo;s only a matter of time really before you&rsquo;re strolling through a mall where mannequins have been replaced with interactive store-front window displays that know your name. Or where you&rsquo;re kicking back in your self-driving car and watching Netflix on your windshield display.</p>

<p>Whether you want it or not - get ready for more screen time.</p>
