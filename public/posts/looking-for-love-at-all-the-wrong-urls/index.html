<p>It&rsquo;s Valentine&rsquo;s Day tomorrow, and what better way to celebrate than to look at the absurdity of love on the internet. The trafficking of human relationships is nothing new on the web, but these websites are the lowest of the low. Let&rsquo;s take a journey through the seedy underbelly of the digital cherub&rsquo;s realm…</p>

<p>First, you head over to <a href="http://www.beautifulpeople.com">beautifulpeople.com</a> and submit your picture. Other members will decide whether you are beautiful enough to join the club. You are accepted, meet the one and get married. I quote from the site: &ldquo;Over 700 couples have been married through unions founded on BeautifulPeople.com. Thousands of people are in committed relationships and many have gone on to start <em>beautiful</em> families.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Second, have an affair by finding a willing adulterer on <a href="http://www.ashleymadison.com/">Ashley Madison</a>. With over 10 million members, cheating has never been easier. Trish McDermott, a consultant who helped found Match.com, describes Ashley Madison as being a &ldquo;business built on the back of broken hearts, ruined marriages and damaged families.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Third, when your marriage falls apart, sign up at <a href="http://wotwentwrong.com/">wotwentwrong.com</a>. A social network for the broken-hearted, this site allows you to get feedback from your ex on why you suck. As your ex may have changed her phone number, the site encourages you to stalk them on Facebook to find their email latest address.</p>

<p>Feeling icky? Take that as a good sign. Now, go out there and be kind to one another for Pete&rsquo;s sake, er… for Valentine&rsquo;s sake.</p>
