          <p>I&rsquo;m perpetually tired these days so it&rsquo;s become the status quo. Sometimes I&rsquo;ll wake up after a long sleep and feel strangely alive, realizing with a surprised recollection that this is what it feels like to be fully awake. It&rsquo;s odd how one learns to adapt to altered physiological states. I have this long running argument with a friend who says that humans don&rsquo;t need to sleep at all, we&rsquo;ve only been socialized to. I&rsquo;m sure this is bollocks but perhaps there is a grain of truth in that idea somewhere.</p>

<p>Yesterday we took the kids out to see a play. It was the Korean version of &ldquo;Cats&rdquo;, rewritten for children of course. I thought it was lame and so did hundreds of other kids in the audience who started rudely and impatiently stamping their feet halfway through the production. There was a mixed response from our lot, some thought it wasn&rsquo;t very funny at all, others were amused by the feline antics. It was a fine, sunny day, so we had our picnic in Ilsan lake park under a large shady tree. Everyone was exhausted after the field trip, but there were still classes to teach and setting up to do for Market Day, so it ended up being a sixteen hour day, we only went home at eleven.</p>

<p>Market Day today. This is basically the one chance kids get to spend their &lsquo;money&rsquo;, they get one dollar if they finish a whole sticker board. They get one sticker as a reward every time they win a game or are good or whatever. It&rsquo;s a lot of work, but they really enjoyed it. They could buy toys and stationary and chocolates and stuff.</p>

<p>It was also Sean&rsquo;s last day and I had a hard time saying goodbye to the little guy. You get really attached to these kids when you see them everyday. I never thought I&rsquo;d be one of those weepy kindergarten teacher types.</p>

<p>My adult students canceled their class today - they&rsquo;re going backpacking in Europe this month, so no adult class for a whole month! This last month has been insane, I&rsquo;m soooo glad it&rsquo;s over. The director was trying to placate any possible teacher rebellions today by feeding us lots of food. We had this seafood soup thing and I bit down on what looked like a tasty nut only to have it explode in my mouth! I was so surprised I spat it right out onto the floor, much to the amusement of the other teachers. When I asked Debbie what it was, she said it was &lsquo;seafood&rsquo;. When I asked what kind of seafood it was, she said &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s a kind of seafood&rdquo;&hellip;I think it was some kind of small animal. At the end of this long day, Debbie actually said &ldquo;Thanks for the effort&rdquo;, which is a lot for her, go Debbie!</p>
