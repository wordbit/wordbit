          <p>I recently wrote<a href="http://wordbit.com/its-your-legacy-own-it/"> a blog post</a> about owning your digital legacy instead of giving it away to sites like Medium. At the end I considered what would happen if I reached the clearing at the end of the road. That is, if I moved onto the next world. Basically, my blog would die  along with me. And that made me a bit sad. So, I&rsquo;ve decided to create an archive of every blog post since the Livejournal days of 2003.</p>

<p>In the process, I even managed to resurrect all posts from wordspace, and old blog that I thought had been completely erased. It turns out that the database is still largely intact. I now believe the site was taken down by spammers. I did notice that there were over two thousand spam comments on one post, so I think it just broke.</p>

<p>Anyway, <a href="http://wordbitarchives.wordpress.com/">you can check out the wordbit archives here</a>. It&rsquo;s a private blog, the same as this. Which means that nobody right now is reading this, except for myself. But when I eventually disappear from planet Earth, at least my words will remain - even if nobody can access them.</p>
