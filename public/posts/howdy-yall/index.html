          <p>My internet connection has been down, so the last entry was posted late, it should be retro-dated to Sunday. Anyways, to illustrate some of the events of the weekend, <a href="http://www.wordbit.freehostia.com/geocities/photo5">click on this link and check out the latest pictures on my website</a>. The one of Kumchon from it&rsquo;s outskirts is really cool. You can get a good idea of the sort of nucleus clustering of settlements I was talking about once.</p>

<p>Yesterday I went out for dinner and then for a few beers with my ex adult students and Sulu. They&rsquo;re such a great bunch of people, I&rsquo;m so sad I&rsquo;m not their teacher any more. We had lots of fun, chatting and joking around, they&rsquo;re really opening up these days. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll get to hang out with them on occasion. Actually, to be honest I like the attention, all the single ladies in the group adore me. I wouldn&rsquo;t get involved with any of them though. Firstly, in my experience, dating someone with poor English makes for a communicative disaster. Secondly, they&rsquo;re all on the hunt for husbands and Koreans (Asians in general actually ) take that sort of thing very seriously. As a matter of interest, in Korea, couples engage in a lengthy courtship which often lasts several years and seldom have sex before marriage. In fact a boyfriend is prohibited from entering a girl&rsquo;s family home until he intends to marry her. Quite conservative really, especially compared to a more liberal Asian country like Japan. Times are changing of course but, according to what I&rsquo;ve observed, the customs I&rsquo;ve just described still seem to be the societal norm.</p>
