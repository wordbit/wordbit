          <h5 id="date"> Wed Mar 13, 2013 </h5>
          <p>I recently read a newsletter from a writer who flew off to this tropical paradise to relax and soak up some sun. She claimed that this getaway really helped her writing - whenever it rains (and in Vancouver, it does - a lot), she closes her eyes and remembers the warmth of the sun on her face. Energized, she then writes with new vigour.</p>

<p>Great idea, but what if you can&rsquo;t afford it? How do you get to the &ldquo;happy place&rdquo; in your mind? What does it look like? It&rsquo;s all a matter of perspective. When I was in Costa Rica a long while back, I met this young guy who said he wanted to move to Canada because there was too much sand in Costa Rica. Too much sand. It gets into everything, you know.</p>

<p>And if you&rsquo;re stressed out,Â  I find that conjuring up some mirage of paradise doesn&rsquo;t really help. Dreaming about an empty beach works for a few seconds, but if you think about it, your happiest memories probably weren&rsquo;t on that beach.</p>

<p>When I tried out a yoga class once (my work was offering it, so I gave it a shot), I didn&rsquo;t find the downward dogs or whatever that transformative. But at one point, our instructor had us curled up in a foetal position on our yoga mats and she told us to close our eyes and think about a time when we had a good laugh with a loved one. The thought of that human moment was more invigorating than our awkward posing.</p>

<p>Also, I kind of like the rain.</p>
