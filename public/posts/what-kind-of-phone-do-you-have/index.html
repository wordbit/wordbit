        <section id="main">
          <h5 id="date"> Sat Feb 4, 2012 </h5>
          <p>I was reading <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2011/11/23/2583441/5-minutes-on-the-verge-limor-fried">an interview with Limor Fried</a>, the alpha-geek who founded the DIY electronics company Adafruit Industries, when I was struck by one of her answers:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What kind of phone do you have?</p>

<p>I do not own a cell phone; however, I have designed aÂ cell-phone jammer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Limor&rsquo;s response was intriguing to me because of its dichotomy between technological know-how and an anti-technology stance. Here is an ubergeek who could reverse engineer a cellphone, yet who claims not to own one.</p>

<p>Yet, if you think about it, why is there this lust in our consumer culture for phones? Granted, it makes life easier for a lot of people, but there&rsquo;s more to it.</p>

<p>Some people feel a sense of shame if they don&rsquo;t own a cellphone. Or even more telling, a twinge of embarrassment if they own a cellphone, but not a smartphone. Look at the poor kid who digs out a quarter and makes a furtive call on the payphone in the mall. The mom who cries inside because the other yummy mummies are tracking their kids&rsquo; progress on their iPhone apps while she scrawls in a scruffy notebook. And God help you if you&rsquo;re a phoneless geek.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is not Limor&rsquo;s answer which is unsettling, but the question itself. What kind of society have we become when the question that measures geek cred is &ldquo;What kind of phone do you have?&rdquo;</p>
