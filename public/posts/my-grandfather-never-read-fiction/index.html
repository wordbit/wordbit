          <p>I&rsquo;m currently reading the excellent book <em>Speaker for the Dead</em> by Orson Scott Card. In case you haven&rsquo;t read it, the speaker investigates a deceased person&rsquo;s life and then delivers a true account of the person - a sort of honest eulogy if you will - where the truth is told in place of polite praise, even if it hurts.</p>

<p>Anyway, this idea got me thinking about my grandfather. I remember the moment clearly. We were sitting on an outdoor deck watching eagles circling through the blue sky. At the time I was reading a lot. Mostly as an escape - you know, a pleasant diversion - the reason most people read books. I asked him about what sort of books he liked to read and he told me that he had never read a work of fiction. I don&rsquo;t remember the next part exactly, except for the fact I was quite startled. As if he had just told me he had never eaten food or bothered to take a breath.</p>

<p>But that was the kind of man he was. He was rooted in reality. He&rsquo;d built his own car from scratch. He faked his age so he could run away and join the navy before he turned 16. I even recall an old picture of him taming a lion with a whip. He was spartan and didn&rsquo;t believe in embellishment, or in people&rsquo;s imaginings. For my birthday, he couldn&rsquo;t stand buying Hallmark cards with fanciful words written in them, so he&rsquo;d cut out a picture of an animal on a cereal box and paste in on an envelope. He did this for every birthday that I remember.</p>

<p>But, he also loved to dance. And I think that&rsquo;s where I can start to comprehend how he&rsquo;d never read a novel. He couldn&rsquo;t care less about carefully orchestrated words on a page, but orchestrations of two bodies gliding through space - that was his escape. He danced a lot. I&rsquo;m not trying to speak for the dead - I just think that it&rsquo;s odd, the sort of things we remember.</p>

<p>I do think everybody deserves to have something real written about them though. Not some generic fluff about how wonderful a person was.</p>
