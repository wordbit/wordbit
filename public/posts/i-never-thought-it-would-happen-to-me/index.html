          <p>I was looking around for the perfect domain name last night and I found it. I’m not going to say what it was because it was just too good. So, I rubbed my hands in glee, took out my credit card and bought it at godaddy. Then I get an email telling me that somebody else owns the name. According to the WHOis database, somebody purchased the name about a minute before I did, but I still got charged for it.</p>

<p>I refuse to believe this was a coincidence. While I was testing the name in Google and on several other sites testing for trademark violations, somebody got a whiff of it and literally stole the name away from right under my nose. Now when you type in the name, an amateur domain auction site comes up. Owned by the same guy who ripped my name off.</p>

<p>My advice: If you have a winner, don’t put it out there too much. Just buy it. I will always mourn the loss of what was probably the greatest domain name ever. Well, if I ever get a refund from godaddy, I’ll have to go back to the drawing board I guess.</p>
