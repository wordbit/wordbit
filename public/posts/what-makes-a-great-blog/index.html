          <p><a href="http://wordbitarchives.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/blog.jpg"><img src="http://wordbitarchives.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/blog.jpg?w=300" alt="" /></a>One of my favourite blogs has to be Derek Miller&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.penmachine.com/">Penmachine</a>. I really enjoy this blog because Derek writes well and he writes often. Derek usually writes about technology, gadgets, software, and other geektastic topics. After getting cancer a year ago, however, his posts have been a lot more personal. He has unceasingly blogged about his harrowing experiences and shared every tear and every joy with his readers, writing in a straightforward, honest style. He recently redesigned his blog and made it a lot cleaner, using a lot of white space and an elegant simplicity (which I like).</p>

<p>Another blog I enjoy reading is Tom Johnson&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.idratherbewriting.com/">I&rsquo;d Rather Be Writing</a>. Tom is a tech writer who feeds his need to write by blogging on technical communication. He also runs a popular tech writing podcast. I like his blog because he writes clearly and is passionate about what he does. His website is also clean, with lots of white space and minimal clutter.</p>
