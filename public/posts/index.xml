      <title>A summer post</title>
      <link>http://wordbit.com/posts/a-summer-post/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s a beautiful Sunday afternoon in the middle of July - a pleasant breeze blows and it isn&amp;rsquo;t sweltering like it was last summer. I&amp;rsquo;m leaning up against a log on the south side of Queen&amp;rsquo;s Park and writing this post on my iPad. The Patullo Bridge is closed this weekend for seismic upgrades, so this area of the park is unusually serene - the drone of traffic crossing the bridge into Surrey is delightfully absent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The groundskeepers tend to ignore this part of the park because it is seldom frequented. It has a slightly unkempt, natural look  - unlike the manicured gardens to the North where happy young couples take wedding pictures in the rose garden. I like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s nothing like sitting quietly in nature. I feel rejuvenated and at peace. Green spaces quench the thirsty soul and wash away the thick stench of the city. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t imagine how unhappy I&amp;rsquo;d feel if I lived in the middle of an urban wasteland. A concrete prison with an apartment window looking at a brick wall and a cubicle at work with no windows at all. I guess a lot of people live that way, which explains a lot about all the aggression and stress in this world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my lunch breaks I go for a run along the Pitt River. Halfway through, I stop at a small beach and sit for awhile. There is an uninhabited island in the middle of the river. It is blanketed in leafy trees and eagles spiral lazily above - guardians of a sanctuary where no people set foot. I gaze at this island and quiet my mind for a few minutes before heading back to work. I always have a more productive afternoon when I do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel lucky to be living here in British Columbia, where there are more trees than people and water is never very far away. The insane real estate in the Vancouver area is disheartening of course, but that is another conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I apologize if this meandering post doesn’t seem to have a point. I’m not trying to write one of those self-righteous diatribes about unplugging and going on a tech detox. Because, as you&amp;rsquo;ve probably figured out, I love technological innovation and trying to suss out its impact on our society. And if you&amp;rsquo;re not into the outdoors, I can respect that - especially if you&amp;rsquo;re honest about it, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/being-canadian-to-me-means-not-giving-a-shit-about-the-outdoors&#34;&gt;like this outdoor-hating Canadian&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the summer does give us all a reminder that moderation in our lives brings greater joy than either overindulgence or abstinence. So, don&amp;rsquo;t forget to create as well as consume. By all means read your Kindle on the beach. But also sit on top of a mountain and write or paint or whatever it is you do to nurture your creative side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you never drink, have a frosty beer on a patio. If you drink too much, then go for a swim instead. If you’re an introverted hermit, find an open space and fly a kite - look up into the blue sky instead of looking down all the time. But seek the shade of a quiet forest if you&amp;rsquo;re a gregarious sun worshipper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kids - I&amp;rsquo;m talking to you now. Have fun going outside to play Pokémon GO, but don&amp;rsquo;t forget to look up and smile at that pretty girl or handsome boy walking down the street. Also, don&amp;rsquo;t look for pokémons in sacred places, like Holocaust Museums. You have better sense than that - it isn&amp;rsquo;t up to the game creators to police your bad behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I guess that&amp;rsquo;s all I have to say this month. Let me take the opportunity to wish you all a glorious summer. Thanks as always for stopping by - I will see you in August.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>WWDC 2016</title>
      <link>http://wordbit.com/posts/apple-wwdc-2016/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Unlike Google and the other guys, there was no talk of AI or bots at Apple’s software showcase this year. Instead, Apple was true to form, highlighting aspects like “differential privacy” and “continuity” - features that keep you locked into their ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the event was fairly low key with Apple focused on improving and polishing rather than innovating (I think it was the announcement of universal cut and paste that got the biggest round of applause).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, I always enjoy sitting down to watch the two-hour infomercial that is the keynote - if only to see what free stuff I’m going to get. Remember when Apple actually charged for software upgrades? It’s way more fun to watch these things &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; you’ve sold your kidney for Apple hardware. There is no angst at WWDC - only benefits for those who have already paid the Apple tax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the keynote was divided into four software platforms, I’ll do the same and comment on each one individually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;watchos-3:9de4ffc85fa46729e7645932707af774&#34;&gt;watchOS 3&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sold on the Apple watch hardware just yet. I still think round smartwatches look far more classic than rectangular ones. Sure, you can read more text on a rectangular display, but I think Jony Ive should have focussed on form, and not function in this case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, Apple is positioning this thing as a fashion accessory - not a Casio calculator watch reboot. Never mind that Tim Cook sees the Apple watch as more of a fitness wearable… Forget trying to please everyone - time to focus guys!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the software side though, I am happy that they gutted the software and started over on the user interface. I’m happy because it means Apple is still committed to developing this product, and future iterations should be way more enticing than the clunky gadget this watch is now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tvos-10:9de4ffc85fa46729e7645932707af774&#34;&gt;tvOS 10&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still have the Apple TV 3, so am not going to get these updates either. But I really don’t need Siri or apps on my Apple TV when I only use it for Netflix and Youtube. Also, the remote app on the iPhone is actually way more useful than the Apple TV 4 physical remote anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the Apple TV has more potential for disruption in the US, but the CRTC in Canada is never going to let the Apple TV take down the cable companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am far more interested in the rumours of an Alexa-like Siri box, possibly bundled into the next-gen Apple TV. We’ll see if those rumours pan out later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;macos-sierra:9de4ffc85fa46729e7645932707af774&#34;&gt;macOS Sierra&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My aging mid-2010 iMac just made the eligibility cutoff this year - iMacs that came out before 2009 are out of luck. I wish I could say that my iMac is aging gracefully, but the HDD hard drive is slowing down and crippling performance to the point of frustration. SSD hard drives were an emerging and expensive technology six years ago, but now it’s a no-brainer to go with solid state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Siri is coming to the Mac, which is good news… I guess? I’ll be able to ask Siri how much hard drive space I have left on my horribly slow hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought it was cool that the desktop and documents folders will be backed up to iCloud… but then again, you only get 5GB of free space, and Apple is pushing hard to put &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; in iCloud so you have to buy more storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I think of it, there isn’t a whole lot in macOS (formerly OS X) that is worth getting excited about, but hey, it’s free! And - that name change!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ios-10:9de4ffc85fa46729e7645932707af774&#34;&gt;iOS 10&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the iPhone is my newest Apple product, I was most interested in what’s new on the mobile front. Oh, and my iPad! I almost forgot you iPad, along with everybody else (drum roll please).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But seriously, even the minor update we got a few months ago with “Night Shift” was legitimately useful. Night Shift, in case you’re not aware, shifts the colour hue from blue to yellow at sunset everyday. I am now quite used to being bathed in a warm yellow glow every night. I wish my Kindle Paperwhite had this feature - the jarring switch to the bright blue Kindle screen after using my iPad at night feels like being blinded with a couple of photon torpedoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, “APIs for third parties” (or, &amp;ldquo;it’s an API party!&amp;rdquo;) was the defining theme of the upcoming improvements - a continuation of Apple’s ongoing efforts to be more open and developer friendly. The idea is that software hooks in Siri, Maps, and iMessage will allow a more seamless user experience. The example Craig Federighi demoed on stage was going to Maps and seeing restaurant reviews, booking a table, calling an Uber to get there, and paying for everything - all without ever leaving Maps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My feelings on this sort of integration hasn’t changed much - the convenience in this scenario is great if you’re a single Silicon-Valley bro with money to burn. But if you’re a family man who needs to shop around for the best price, and needs to install car seats for the kids, and… well, let’s just say I can think of many ways to kibosh the above scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parts of iOS 10 that I like the best are the user interface improvements. The lock screen, control centre, notifications screen, and “Siri suggestions” screen (all in heavy day-to-day use) have all been revamped. Rich notifications and widgets on the lock screen with 3D-Touch support are especially great. Design-wise, they look a lot like the “Google Now cards”, which I&amp;rsquo;ve always thought were fantastic, and I can’t blame Apple for copying them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of people have said this, and I agree - at this point it doesn’t matter who is copying who. Android and iOS are borrowing the best from each other and are both converging into a user-focused paradigm. The result is a win for everybody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;closing-thoughts:9de4ffc85fa46729e7645932707af774&#34;&gt;Closing thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed watching the keynote, in the same way I enjoy listening to an old record. The familiarity and rhythm of it is pleasing in a way. But I’m not too happy about Apple trying to supplement flagging iPhone sales (in terms of growth, not revenue) by pushing paid services on us. It feels a bit disingenuous to claim you want a magical user experience on one hand, then push iCloud upgrades and accessories on the other (ooh look - you can unlock your iMac with your Apple watch - well why not with your iPhone?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;September is going to be interesting because it looks like Apple is going to ditch the tick-tock iPhone overhaul pattern. Rumours are pointing to a modest upgrade this year, with a radical design change slated for 2017 - the 10th anniversary of the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are savvy Apple fans going to forgo the upgrade this year and cost Apple billions of dollars in lost revenue? Stranger things have happened, I suppose. But there was nothing strange about WWDC 2016 (well, there was that rap-along) - on the software front, it&amp;rsquo;s business as usual, and that&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Google I/O 2016</title>
      <link>http://wordbit.com/posts/google-io-2016/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 28 May 2016 17:42:22 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://wordbit.com/posts/google-io-2016/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I sat down to watch this year’s I/O keynote, I couldn’t &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordbit.com/posts/rise-of-the-google-machine/&#34;&gt;help but recall&lt;/a&gt; last year’s incredible gift to the Google faithful - Google Photos. Free unlimited uploads in their full resolution for pictures under 16MP. It was, and still is, an amazing service. It even uploads Live Photos on my iPhone 6S - something that even iCloud’s photostream doesn’t do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a few years from now, Google will hold our bloated photo libraries hostage in exchange for our souls, but so far this hasn’t happened. And maybe when it does happen, we’ll willingly pay the price. It&amp;rsquo;s so easy to become addicted to the machine learning that organizes our pictures and creates photo albums for us; machine learning that can identify the content of every photo. How could you not love searching for “hugs” to view all those pictures of your loved ones engaged in a warm embrace?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year there were no surprise gifts, but Google continued to show off its burgeoning AI prowess. A new messaging app was shown with eerie “smart replies” that allows the AI to answer in your stead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Picture a world where text message conversations are going on in the background between your AI and another person. Or even between two AIs. We’ll be able to abscond all social responsibility by surrendering social conversations to chatbots. In fact, this world is here already with AIs such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.ai/&#34;&gt;Amy&lt;/a&gt;, a “personal assistant” who schedules meetings for you. I expect chatbot AIs to proliferate wildly in the next few years, and could even be “the next big thing”. Companies who don’t manage to catch the next wave &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theverge.com/2016/5/25/11765624/walt-mossberg-apple-wwdc-2016-siri-ai-bots&#34;&gt;could find themselves left behind&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Google is throwing considerable weight behind its AI efforts, and the results are impressive. However, the AI application in Google Photos seems almost heartwarming compared to this year’s offerings. The messaging app, Allo, will almost certainly be ignored, considering the sheer number of messaging apps available, several of which Google has already put out there and left to stagnate (hangouts anyone?). Ultimately the messaging demo came across like that annoying smart kid in class who tries to entertain others by showing off how clever he is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A far more interesting application of Google’s AI (simply called Google Assistant) was shown in &lt;a href=&#34;https://home.google.com/&#34;&gt;Google Home&lt;/a&gt; - an unabashed ripoff of Amazon’s Echo. Copying an existing product isn’t going to elicit gasps of amazement from the crowd, but competition in this area isn’t a bad thing either. Yet, while the Echo allows you to order replacement toilet paper with a spoken command (from Amazon of course), Google has a grander vision. They already have excellent AI chops, as evident in the “OK Google” voice commands in the mobile space. If done right, Home could conceivably become that omniscient computer in the sky that Star Trek fans are intimately familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rumours have already started flying that Apple is also working on an ambient personal assistant to rival Echo - perhaps a revised Apple TV with facial-recognition cameras. But for now, we’ll put Apple speculation aside until WWDC in a couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sundar Pichai clearly sees AI as an avenue where Google can excel, and I tend to agree with him. No other company has the foundation of search algorithms, machine learning, big data, and access to a treasure trove of user data like Google has. And, very importantly, no other large-scale company is so comfortable being platform agnostic. While true sentient AI is a long way off, they are poised to usher in skynet’s great grandfather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this scares you, then it is simply because you are a denizen of the information age whose modus operandi revolves around you as the information gatherer - with you at the helm. It isn’t easy to relinquish control - just as it wasn’t easy for people at the tail end of the industrial age to abandon their reliance on physical manufacturing as their primary economic driver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if all this doesn’t scare you, then you’re probably reading this in the 22nd century. Perhaps you are amazed that humans once engaged in independent thought. Perhaps in surrendering the sanctity of your privacy and your body to the machine, you are now at peace because your human toils are over. Perhaps you have evolved into a cyborg with some sort of AI synthesis, like in the &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 3&lt;/em&gt; ending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all seriousness though - regardless of where you stand today, the information age is reaching an end. If you cling to the old ways, you are now an anachronism in the looming AI age. It is still unclear what our roles will be in this new age, but what is clear is that we won’t be controlling the flow and manipulation of information anymore. If knowledge is power, then the machines have already won.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unrequited</title>
      <link>http://wordbit.com/posts/unrequited/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 21:37:22 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://wordbit.com/posts/unrequited/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear user,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve never met, but I write to you every day. Writing to you is my job, but still, I do care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It starts with the small things. Knowing the frustration of ambiguity, I try to choose the perfect words for you. I painstakingly pore over both our company’s Language Guide, as well as the latest Simplified Technical English specification to ensure I am not using any forbidden words. I also try to use terminology consistently, so that I don’t give the same part two different names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also never use the word &amp;ldquo;utilize&amp;rdquo;. Although, to my abject horror, one instance did slip through when I copied some text from the Sales and Marketing department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then craft the perfect sentences - not too long, not too complex, but with delightful variations in syntactic structure so that you don’t get bored. I polish these sentences so that they are as smooth and round as a river stone, and can therefore be reused in multiple contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These shiny sentences are placed in self-contained topics, as per DITA guidelines. You can get all the information you are looking for, whether it be an explanation or a procedure, just by reading this brief chunk of text. I will never hyperlink you away to other topics, or expect you to hunt for crucial details elsewhere - I know your time is valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to make your job easier, because I know you’re a tough guy who does tough work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re a structural engineer who needs to inspect your bridge pylons. You’re a fisherman at sea trawling for your catch. You’re an ROV operator trying to dig an underwater trench. You’re a police officer on a diving team assigned to investigate the latest homicide. You’re &amp;ldquo;in the Navy now&amp;rdquo; and your commanding officer just assigned you to berth clearance and underwater security. You’re a treasure hunter who is looking for that lost shipwreck - you know the one with all that Spanish gold on it, like in &lt;em&gt;The Goonies&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as much as I respect what you do, I must confess that I’m not wholly altruistic in my motives. After all, the constant companion during my days of writing is not you - it is the words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allow me an allegory. The blacksmith who makes a sword for a knight certainly wants the knight to succeed. If the sword snaps, if the weight is off, if shoddy workmanship results in a lethal end for the knight on the battlefield, then both the blacksmith&amp;rsquo;s pride and reputation will suffer. But the blacksmith’s true love is in the forging of the sword and in transforming raw and molten metals into something greater. What the blacksmith savours more than fame or glory is the slow process of hammering out the metal and continuously reshaping it until a weapon emerges. A weapon that not only performs its function, but could be seen by some as a work of art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it is with writing manuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This love I have for the craft is why I am not concerned whether you RTFM. In fact, I sincerely hope that you do not ever have to read one of my manuals from cover to cover. I am also nonplussed that my endless word tinkering will go largely unappreciated. You will never wax eloquent over the use of an Oxford Comma while figuring out how to operate your sonar. You won’t go on your smoke break and nod your head sagely at a particularly snappy sentence that says in four words what other less meticulous writers say in fifteen words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, I am your invisible defender and advocate. I am the guardian angel that you will never know you have. I even go toe-to-toe with software developers over language nuances in the user interface that software developers most certainly do not care about. Software developers only care about the little piece of code they are working on - they’re not concerned with the big picture. Mostly. I’m painting with a large brush here, but this has been my experience most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our software lead does write great user experience specifications though - complete with user stories about a stick figure named Joe. Software engineers actually documenting things is an astoundingly rare occurence, however. And if you&amp;rsquo;re a software developer, I expect you&amp;rsquo;ll be nodding along in agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you see, dear user, that I do care. But even though I write &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; you every day, I do not write &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; you every day. I write for me. This is true of all writers, no matter who they are and what they write. Do you think Stephen King needs you to buy any more of his novels? The short answer is: hahaha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, even though we write mostly to amuse ourselves, a rising tide lifts all boats, as JFK once said. Good writing benefits everyone - and it is my gift to you, dear user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regards,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your friendly neighbourhood technical writer&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tesla&#39;s Model 3</title>
      <link>http://wordbit.com/posts/tesla-model-three/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 08 Apr 2016 20:51:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://wordbit.com/posts/tesla-model-three/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tesla’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.teslamotors.com/model3&#34;&gt;Model 3&lt;/a&gt; is not only a jaw-droppingly stylish car, it is also a compelling window into a future world where the electric car is king.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It certainly has anyone who is interested in technology and design drooling. Tesla’s electric cars come across as gadgets, complete with over-the-air software upgrades - not boring utilitarian vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the Model 3 truly is a product of the tech industry. It’s also an eccentric genius billionaire’s baby. Which makes Tesla a truly unique company, and the Model 3 an astoundingly fresh entrant in a stale car industry. An industry, by the way, that last saw true innovation over a hundred years ago with the debut of Henry Ford’s Model T.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But is the Model 3 really a vision of the future, or merely a mirage?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seven years ago I wrote an article called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alive.com/lifestyle/the-eco-dilemma/&#34;&gt;The Eco Dilemma&lt;/a&gt; about the electric car as a utopian fantasy. At the time, the economy was in shambles, gas prices were sky high, climate change was scaring the hell out of us, and there was strong interest in alternatives to fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the economy is better, gas is dirt cheap, and people are sick of hearing about climate change. Besides from this, my article still stands true. I stand by my conclusion that what we need most are sustainable communities based on an analysis of local needs, whether that be effective public transit in urban areas, or telecommuting in the suburbs. The car, after all - whether electric or gas-powered - does reek of that entitled Western mentality born out of the 1950s American dream of mass suburbia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, although going car-free is a laudable option, it is probably most appealing to that small subset of Earth’s population who want to save money and have access to decent public transit (being green is just a bonus title they can claim for brownie points). Totally doable if you live, for example, in New York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for the vast majority who must drive, or prefer it, electric cars seem like a way to have your cake and eat it too. Assuming, of course, your local electrical grid sources its power from clean energy. I mentioned this particular quandary in my article and it &lt;a href=&#34;http://gizmodo.com/why-teslas-model-3-car-cant-fix-our-energy-problems-1768095326&#34;&gt;still stands true today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scaling up an electric car infrastructure for mass adoption is arguably a more insurmountable problem than engineering appealing and relatively affordable electric cars. In fact, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wired.com/2016/01/gm-electric-car-chevy-bolt-mary-barra/&#34;&gt;General Motors will actually beat Tesla&lt;/a&gt; in bringing a $35000 electric car with a 200-mile range to the masses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla has some answers to the infrastructure problem. Their supercharger network may ease range anxiety for the few times a year that you go on a road trip. A more pressing infrastructure challenge may be building enough centres to service a massive influx of new customers. The same challenge will apply to any manufacturer who has invested in a gas-centric infrastructure for the past 100 years - pivoting is no easy task (GM take note).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting an astounding number of pre-orders, there is also some doubt as to whether Tesla can ramp up production fast enough to meet all the pent-up demand. And do so with sufficient quality control so that there aren’t &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theverge.com/2016/4/8/11393278/tesla-model-3-vs-apple-iphone-sales-compared&#34;&gt;too many defects introduced&lt;/a&gt; with such rapid production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this is all conjecture at this point - I’m willing to give Tesla the benefit of the doubt and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I would love to own a Model 3, despite these uncertainties - and I’m no car guy. Maybe it was reading Elon’s biography (by Ashlee Vance) that sold me on Tesla as part of a grand vision (that culminates in sending people to Mars). Or maybe it was insane blog posts like &lt;a href=&#34;http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/how-tesla-will-change-your-life.html&#34;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps I’m just a sucker for shiny new tech, and as I mentioned earlier - Tesla is basically software on wheels, not a bunch of controlled explosions stuffed into a tin can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately though, I’m probably not going to end up in the Model 3 driver’s seat (note that I did not say “never”, because hopelessness is so gauche, you know).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sobering fact is that the Model 3 is still unaffordable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Model 3 may be priced to sell (whatever that is supposed to mean) in the US at least. However, with the Canadian dollar at an all-time low, $35000 US ends up being almost $46000 at today’s exchange rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that British Columbia’s energy supply is relatively clean, with 86 percent generated by hydroelectricity. The bad news is that BC’s subsidy for buying electric cars is only $5000, or up to $8250 if you scrap your old car. In Ontario, you can get up to $14000 off. Norway has insane incentives - in fact, the Model S is actually the &lt;em&gt;overall&lt;/em&gt; number one selling car over there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, for electric cars to be practical, you need to live in a detached house with a garage. When charging the batteries overnight, street parking isn’t going to cut it. In Vancouver, the average price for a detached home is almost $2 million dollars (as of March 2016). Yes, you read that right. Vancouver has the most expensive real estate in Canada, so most of us, including our family, live in a condo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, most condo strata councils aren’t exactly forward thinking. You could end up like &lt;a href=&#34;http://bc.ctvnews.ca/no-charge-couple-forced-to-move-because-of-electric-vehicle-1.1987615&#34;&gt;this guy&lt;/a&gt;, who was forced to move because his strata refused to let him charge his electric car (now that is a true green warrior - he would rather sell his condo than sell his car). He offered more than enough money to cover the costs, so it wasn’t even a financial thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in summary, to get a Model 3, you need to spend at least $40000 to buy it new (you could buy a new Mercedes-Benz for that price), and own a detached house so that you can charge it every night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, this is no car for “the everyman”, especially in this city, where you’d have to be a millionaire to afford it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, does my dream to own a Model 3 die here, in this obscure blog post at the end of the internet? Well, there is always hope. Hope and the kidney black market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it is easier to just sit back and appreciate the turn of the tide. To bear witness to a new era of innovation in the auto industry. That in itself will be a boon to our battered planet, because yes, I still care about our planet a little, even if I won’t be driving a green dream machine to prove it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Batman v Superman</title>
      <link>http://wordbit.com/posts/batman-v-superman/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 25 Mar 2016 20:09:22 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://wordbit.com/posts/batman-v-superman/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a poignant moment in &lt;em&gt;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&lt;/em&gt; when the Holy Grail crosses the Great Seal and triggers the collapse of the Temple of the Sun. The earth is torn asunder, and Elsa, a Nazi agent and Austrian archaeologist, loses her life. After Indiana Jones fails to save her, he ends up hanging precariously in the crevice himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indiana’s father catches his hand and tries to pull him to safety. But, with his other hand, Indiana tries to reach the Holy Grail, which rests tantalizingly on a narrow ledge nearby. He can almost reach it; his fingertips brush it. But his father cannot hold on as oily sweat causes their hands to slip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indiana’s father (so aptly played by Sean Connery), says, in a soft, gentle voice: “Indiana… Indiana… let it go”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he does. As Indiana rides into the sunset and John William’s theme song swells over the closing credits, we knew it really was his last crusade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we were wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twenty years later, a considerably older and stiffer Harrison Ford donned Indie’s hat once more for a mostly terrible comeback movie with a crystal skull and that kid from &lt;em&gt;Transformers&lt;/em&gt;. It wasn’t a huge deal though. At worst, the flick was nothing more than an embarrassing footnote, best ignored. At best, a bonus Blu-ray tacked onto the already excellent Indiana Jones trilogy box set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, they just couldn’t let it go. Indiana Jones is slated to return in 2019, starring an almost 80-year old Harrison Ford. There is no doubt in anyone’s mind that it will be humiliating and awful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also completely unsurprising. The status quo in a talent-starved Hollywood is to play it safe amid decreasing revenues. It has been this way for years now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cries of indignation from the fans are depressingly familiar. Please stop messing with my childhood. Please stop corrupting the purity of my trilogy box sets. Please stop commodifying nostalgia and cheapening the originals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Hollywood isn’t going to stop anytime soon, because they’ve hit upon a winning formula. Appeal to the nostalgia of older audiences while remixing, rebooting, and resurrecting box-office darlings for new audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, this formula pays off. For example, the Star Wars reboot, &lt;em&gt;The Force Awakens&lt;/em&gt;, was an appealing return to the Star Wars universe, despite re-hashing the exact same plot of &lt;em&gt;A New Hope&lt;/em&gt;. But a strong female lead, a tight script, and J.J. Abrams managed to re-energize the property (I doubt whether the next Star Wars movies can repeat this feat).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most often, though, it is all too easy to overdo an homage to the original without being original - &lt;em&gt;Jurassic World&lt;/em&gt; springs to mind. Or to try too hard - an all-female &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters&lt;/em&gt; reboot seems a bit blunt and unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, after all avenues have been explored, everything just implodes on itself like a family squabble that nobody outside the family really cares about. Why is Superman fighting Batman? Why is Iron Man fighting Captain America? Who knows? Who cares? You’ve lost us - and in some cases, even alienated us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t seen &lt;em&gt;Batman v Superman&lt;/em&gt; yet, but the critics have slammed it, and a lot of Superman fans are disappointed about such a dark departure from the Christopher Reeve era. Drop Lex Luthor off at the local prison while trading family-friendly quips, or just snap his neck? This conflict is explored in a far more nuanced way in excellent new Netflix shows like &lt;em&gt;Daredevil&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Jessica Jones&lt;/em&gt;. But injecting “realism” into Superman does nothing more than taint the ethos of a celebrated superhero that arose in the patriotic 1930s. He is not your hero - he is your grandfather’s hero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All our cherished characters belong to a unique and idiosyncratic time and place. And they need to stay in the past. They are part of our history, our upbringing, our collective mythos, shared from parent to child. When we offer new perspectives and reimaginings of old characters, will our children appreciate the originals with us, or adopt the shiny, corrupted versions as the “real” incarnation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, there is hope. Perhaps the tides are shifting. As fans, we used to be grateful for even terrible movies about our heroes, because there were so few. But now… there really is no reason to watch a bad Superman movie. Zack Snyder isn’t holding a gun between our eyes and forcing us to watch it. We have a choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And maybe the best choice is to let it go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;EDIT - May 12, 2016: I couldn&#39;t let it go. I did pay good money to see Batman duking it out with Superman. My friends wanted to see it so I had to swallow my righteousness and join the unwashed masses in the cinema. It was pretty much what I expected. Wonder Woman was fantastic, but man, they need to hire better writers. What would it take to get the Avengers writing team to give it a go? Too much, I reckon.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Battle of the five armies</title>
      <link>http://wordbit.com/posts/battle-of-the-five-armies/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 13 Mar 2016 15:16:22 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://wordbit.com/posts/battle-of-the-five-armies/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Kanye West&amp;rsquo;s new album, &lt;em&gt;The Life of Pablo&lt;/em&gt;, is fantastic. At least, that&amp;rsquo;s what people who&amp;rsquo;ve signed up for Tidal say. Because Jay Z’s streaming service is the only place you can get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except for, of course, other illicit means. But we’ll get to that later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, after the album’s release, Kanye crowed on Twitter that his album will never be available on Apple Music (or on CDs for that matter).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It feels like the West Coast vs East Coast rivalry all over again. We have Apple Music on the West Coast, with Dr. Dre and friends. Then we have Jay Z and crew representing the East Coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, should I say, the metaphorical East Coast. Because it’s not like Jay Z or Kanye actually live in the godforsaken east. They live in California of course, along with everybody else famous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But clearly, Kanye does not want to attend any more parties in L.A. So, what gives?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The music industry is in disarray and everybody is living in the wild west regardless of previous alliances. It’s a mexican standoff between Spotify, Google Music, Pandora, Apple Music, and Tidal. Or as I like to call it, the battle of the five armies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a mess. The heavy hitters, like Kanye, hold a gun to the heads of their fans and demand lock-in to their distribution channel of choice. Or, like Taylor Swift and Adele, simply abstain from the streaming wars altogether and rake in their own profits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, lesser-known artists spread themselves thin over the multitude of disparate options out there and hope that somewhere out there, some music recommendation algorithm will unwittingly promote their music because it sounds like a cross between Justin Bieber and Drake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which leaves us, the consumers, as nothing more than collateral damage as the five armies duke it out. Paying $120 a year for a streaming service is about $120 more than most people spend on buying CDs these days. But we are willing to pay it because of the incredible value proposition of having access to all the music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is no way we’re going to sign up for more than one service. Or jump ship and lose our entire libraries. Which leaves the doors wide open for piracy. It’s no wonder that Kanye’s new album is one of the most torrented albums of all time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s just address the elephant in the room. As music fans, of course we care about how much the artists get paid. But the world has moved on from buying $18 CDs. That cash cow is well and truly hamburger, and there’s no going back. We need a sustainable industry, and maybe some painful market correction, and maybe, just maybe, artistic integrity will blossom to breathe life into music once again. Cut the strings off industry puppets and all that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And those hard-working musicians who don’t wield the same clout as Taylor and Kanye know what they have to do to survive. Tour. Tour like hell for the next twenty or thirty years, pandering and nurturing and keeping their fan base alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as consumers we selfishly want it all. We want a new world order in music. One place to go for all our music. I think we’re all secretly hoping for some sort of consolidation and monopoly to unite the fractured mess of the industry. That is why we eagerly read rumours of Samsung buying Tidal and hope it’s true. Whispers of Google acquiring Spotify. Hell, yes. Apple buying, well, just about anyone they want to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Services like Rdio go under, and we shrug at another casualty of the war. Because all we want is a winner. This war, after all, isn’t about us - or what is best for the consumer. So, all we can hope for is that when the dust settles, our new leader is the lesser of five evils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because that new Kanye album is really good, damn it. Just don’t ask me how I know this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;EDIT - April 8, 2016: So Kanye released his latest album on all the major streaming services, including Apple Music. So either Kanye is a chronic liar, or he&#39;s blowing in the wind like a whimsical fairy. That&#39;s the nicest way I can put it. Either way, I&#39;m happy.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The nightmares in our DNA</title>
      <link>http://wordbit.com/posts/nightmares-in-our-dna/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 27 Feb 2016 15:36:22 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://wordbit.com/posts/nightmares-in-our-dna/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure you are familiar with the “nature vs nurture” debate. If not, google it - I’ll wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got it? Good. For me, most explanations for human behaviour can be lumped into the “nurture” side - a bias, no doubt, fostered by my time studying anthropology at university.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is something to be said for the “nature” side as well. Evolution bakes instinctual responses into the DNA of all animals, after all. Horses, for example, have an innate fear of snakes, and therefore snake-like objects. Sometimes, a horse will rear when faced with a snake-shaped stick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what vestigial instincts from our hunter gatherer days linger on to colour our nightmares today? Most people assume that man has always been at the top of the food chain; but this assumption is an arrogant one, albeit unsurprising. We’ve been top dog for thousands of years now and are used to our dominion over all of God’s creatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a different story thousands of years ago. There was an animal that evolved to be a specialist predator on humans - the Dinofelis. When mountain lions and other big cats attack a human today, the victim often survives because modern cats don’t have teeth that can pierce our skulls. The Dinofelis, however, had short, dagger-like teeth that punctured the skull with one bite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The grisly forensic evidence can be found today in African caves, where skulls show the tooth holes left by this slinking predator who attacked in the dark of night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans fought back. We invented spears and other piercing weapons. We drove the Dinofelis into extinction. We won.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the nightmares remain in our ancestral memory. They are the monsters under our bed. The silent menace in the dark. Nobody has to teach a young child to be scared of large cats. I’ve seen this for myself. When I pretend to be an elephant, or even a snake or a bear, my kids laugh it off. But when I pretend to be a slinking tiger-like creature, complete with cat like movements, my kids run screaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We feel safe when have control over our environments. Perhaps our domestication of cats is an attempt to subjugate our former oppressors and desensitize our primal fears. Maybe we find cats amusing because we’ve performed the ultimate reversal and made our greatest enemy&amp;hellip;cute. Is it any accident that we invented the Internet so we could watch cat videos all day long?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I misspoke a little when I said we are top dogs on planet Earth. We are still prey to micro-organisms that we can’t defend against with traditional weapons. Disease, plagues, viruses, and other modern killers of our overpopulated world were not nearly as devastating to the small nomadic tribes in our distant past. But our homogenous and globalized societies today are especially susceptible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the next nightmare to insinuate itself into our DNA will be of large crowds where diseases spread like wildfire. Perhaps, in some post-apocalyptic future we will have reverted to roaming in small cohesive groups, using our human ingenuity and survival skills to elude the vast zombie hordes that threaten to infect us. Wait a minute, did I just describe &lt;em&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt;? The most popular show on TV right now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems our collective nightmare has already begun.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What to look forward to in 2016</title>
      <link>http://wordbit.com/posts/what-to-look-forward-to-in-2016/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 16 Jan 2016 14:00:22 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://wordbit.com/posts/what-to-look-forward-to-in-2016/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s January and most people like to write about New Year resolutions, or predictions for the year ahead. But I’m quite tired. And no, I didn’t mean that to sound like a sardonic riff of a &lt;em&gt;Flight of the Conchords&lt;/em&gt; song. I just feel like writing something more free flowing and fun that requires less research, intense pondering or tortured introspection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I’m going to compile a breezy list of things I’m looking forward to in 2016. Just off the top of my head. And in no particular order. Yes, the year ahead will bring weddings and babies (not mine, just to be clear), which is all very exciting of course. And I have a new job to sink my teeth into, which is very satisfying. I also want to be… better in 2016, in many ways. But forget about that for now. Let’s talk about music, tech, movies, games, books, and that sort of superficial, but fun, fluffy stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here are some random things to look forward to in 2016:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kanye West’s new album is coming out next month. Regardless of whether you harbour fierce admiration for the man, or dismiss him as a pompous twat - you can’t deny that Kanye is one heck of a reliable tastemaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uncharted 4&lt;/em&gt; is coming out this April. But here’s the thing - my TV has refused to acknowledge my PS3 for the past six months, and I don’t know who broke up with who. If it’s the PlayStation that decided to move on, then perhaps a PS4 will bring back the console love. Also, PlayStation VR is coming sometime this year, and I’m definitely looking forward to trying it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&lt;/em&gt; is coming out in March. I’m still not sure about Ben Affleck, or about Jack Snyder, or about DC’s track record in general, so this movie could most definitely disappoint. But - Superman!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to TV, I&amp;rsquo;m a 100-percent Netflix man, since I cancelled cable quite some time ago. However, I&amp;rsquo;m still partial to &lt;em&gt;Survivor&lt;/em&gt; - a show that is like your favourite uncle - always there and always dependable. I&amp;rsquo;m also a big &lt;em&gt;Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt; fan - and it looks like that show isn&amp;rsquo;t going away any time soon, although I&amp;rsquo;m sure they will run out of shocking situations to explore at some point. I&amp;rsquo;m a season behind, but I&amp;rsquo;m okay with that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Book releases are few and far between - and George Martin recently dropped the bomb that &lt;em&gt;The Winds of Winter&lt;/em&gt; will not be finished before the next season of the TV show leapfrogs the book and brings with it unprecedented spoilers for book lovers. But despite the fact that the &lt;em&gt;Song of Fire and Ice&lt;/em&gt; has become a mummer’s farce, there are at least two other releases to look forward to: Scott Lynch’s &lt;em&gt;The Thorn of Emberlain&lt;/em&gt;, and Justin Cronin’s &lt;em&gt;The City of Mirrors&lt;/em&gt;. On the whole, it’s more satisfying to just read a book series that has already been completed. Except for Brandon Sanderson’s books - that guy writes unnaturally fast, I tell you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The iPhone 7 is coming out this year, and it’s a “tick” design-refresh year in the tick-tock cycle. Man, that sounds ridiculous, but that’s how people talk about the iPhone now. I just got the iPhone, so of course I won’t be upgrading any time soon. But I’m curious to see if Apple decides to ditch the home button and go with that clean all-screen look that seems like an inevitable design evolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of tech, cars are finally roaring into the 21st century - or should I say, electric cars are silently cruising into the new millennium with insane battery tech. Chevy just beat Tesla to the punch with it’s 30K Bolt that has an impressive 200-mile range. But Tesla is sure to announce the Model 3 this year, and Elon’s vision is just too compelling at this point to not be excited in any way. The magical bundle is undoubtedly a mass-market car that is both autonomous and electric. Google is making great progress and Apple’s “secret” car project is blowing too much smoke to be mere ephemeral R&amp;amp;D tinkering - an Apple car is almost certainly far into development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year hasn&amp;rsquo;t started out on the best footing. Low oil prices have decimated the Canadian economy and driven our dollar down so far that a trip to the States is an extravagant luxury. On the other hand, house prices have shot up so high that little old ladies can&amp;rsquo;t afford property tax on their two million dollar shacks. And when looking at the big picture, a recent earthquake reminded us that the big one could hit at any moment and level the West Coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, why not enjoy the little things? A good book. A good movie. A year of simple delights. That sounds quite delectable to me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Norway</title>
      <link>http://wordbit.com/posts/Norway/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 12 Dec 2015 09:05:22 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://wordbit.com/posts/Norway/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, since I have a five-hour layover here in Amsterdam, I may as well rustle together some thoughts on my trip to Norway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only reason for my visit was for work, so let me start with my time at Kongsberg Maritime. After an unsuccessful attempt at using DITA at VTech, I was a little skeptical about plunging into structured authoring, although I was willing to learn the tools of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Ragnar, the senior information developer over there, put me through a DITA boot camp where he promised I would eat, sleep, and dream of XML and DITA. And I did. So, did I emerge a DITA disciple, ready to spread the word at home?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, yes and no. On the negative side, DITA can feel a bit restrictive with its strict, rule-based architecture. And it was a bit discouraging to learn that only 15 companies in the world use a combination of Arbortext on the front-end and SDL Livecontent on the back-end for their documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, on the positive side, the true power of DITA only emerges when you’re working with a geographically diverse group of writers. Actually, I would go so far as to say that solo writers would do well to stay far, far away from DITA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are about 30 writers within the company that all share the same database. The immediate benefits to this are obvious. Although nobody shares the exact same product, they’re similar enough that you can most likely re-use content that somebody else has written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all share the same manual types, chapter headings, and boilerplate text. Even sentences are written to be as “round” as possible so that they are generic enough to be re-used everywhere. Variables and conditional text add product-specific contextualization. The database is organized to facilitate discovery and contributions to library topics is encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The supports in place are varied. A DITA steering committee of about five people at HQ oversees the XML implementation and manages requests from the writers. Each member specializes in one area, such as template improvements, or metadata tags and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also regional groups - I am now a member of the Horten Doc and DITA crew - aka the Conref champions! Even though there&amp;rsquo;s only one of me in Vancouver, it&amp;rsquo;s great to have the resource of other writers. After all, nobody understands a writer more than another writer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I was working most of the time, I did have a free weekend to explore Norway a little. On the Saturday, Ragnar was kind enough to take me into Oslo for the day. We visited the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khm.uio.no/english/visit-us/viking-ship-museum/&#34;&gt;Viking Ship museum&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.norskfolkemuseum.no/en/&#34;&gt;Norwegian folk museum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forsvarsbygg.no/festningene/Festningene/Akershus-festning/English/&#34;&gt;Akershus Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forsvaretsmuseer.no/nor/Hjemmefrontmuseet&#34;&gt;Resistance museum&lt;/a&gt;. I especially enjoyed that last one - hearing the stories of Norway’s resistance movement during the Nazi occupation was both fascinating and unbelievable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Sunday, I checked out &lt;a href=&#34;http://midgardsenteret.no/en/om-midgard/the-borre-park/&#34;&gt;Borre national park&lt;/a&gt; where several Viking burial mounds continue to skulk silently beside the desolate coast. It was here where they excavated the famous Viking ships. A haunting and beautiful place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some general observations about Norway and Norwegian culture (Buzzfeed headline: 10 facts about Norway you&amp;rsquo;ll never believe!):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Norwegians eat pizza with a fork and knife. They also don’t use any condiments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They prefer diesel over gasoline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nobody thinks twice about drinking coffee in an outdoor patio. In the winter. With no heaters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is cheaper to buy groceries in Sweden, but it is somewhat frowned upon. Also, Swedish cookies are so good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Norwegians will tell you they only speak a “little” English, then speak it fluently. But there seems to be a lot of variety in their accents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many traditional foods involve putrified fish - unsurprisingly most Norwegians don&amp;rsquo;t like it that much. I did, however, have a traditional Christmas dish called Pinnekjøtt, a really good lamb dish that all Norwegians enjoy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Norwegians start work really early. And they eat lunch at 11AM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The streets are empty during the day - presumably because everybody either works or goes to school. Little kids all go to daycare because it is free. So no stay-at-home parents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everybody has bitter stories about how some people collect their welfare checks to buy cars and take vacations while hard-working Norwegians support their lazy asses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I guess I should mention that Norway is horribly expensive, but it is a socialist country after all, so there is a good reason for Norway’s reputation as a pricey destination. Still, when visitors like me end up paying $15 for a beer and get taxed 25% on top of that, this reputation is hard to refute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, Norway felt like the more remote parts of Canada where good working-class people try to carve out their lives in the barren landscape. It is almost nothing like Vancouver, which seems ridiculously ostentatious in comparison. And that was refreshing to me. There&amp;rsquo;s a fantastic Beach House song called, well, “Norway”. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L_R-DELtX8&#34;&gt;Listen to it&lt;/a&gt;. You may dream of a country far away, shrouded in mist, carved up by fjords, air crisp with the tang of the sea. Yet there are sombre undertones - a mourning, an aching, a sadness that is beautiful in itself.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2015 Flagship winner</title>
      <link>http://wordbit.com/posts/2015-flagship-winner/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 19 Nov 2015 20:00:22 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://wordbit.com/posts/2015-flagship-winner/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The choice came down to four phones: the &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordbit.com/posts/2015-flagship-1-htc-one-m9/&#34;&gt;HTC One M9&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordbit.com/posts/2015-flagship-2-samsung-galaxy-s6/&#34;&gt;Samsung Galaxy S6&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordbit.com/posts/1271/&#34;&gt;LG G4&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordbit.com/posts/2015-flagship-4-iphone-6s/&#34;&gt;iPhone 6s&lt;/a&gt;. In actuality, a more stark dichotomy lay between Android and Apple, so the choice really came down to two very different approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been living with both Android and iOS, so appreciate the merits of both operating systems. For me, hardware was a bigger consideration, as well as ongoing software support. I also didn&amp;rsquo;t want a gigantic slab of a phone that seems to be the norm these days. So, in the end, I decided to go with the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest - another factor in my decision was the company brand, and everything that brand stands for. For this reason, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even consider Huawei&amp;rsquo;s Nexus 6P, even though it seems very well made. People quickly forget, but Huawei has been suspected of &lt;a href=&#34;http://gizmodo.com/5949821/chinas-biggest-telecomms-are-officially-national-security-risks-updated&#34;&gt;spying for the Chinese government&lt;/a&gt;, even though they, of course, deny it. On the other hand, Apple is well known for its stance on privacy and security, perhaps even more so under Tim Cook&amp;rsquo;s reign. After all, Tim is an intensely private person, to the point where protecting people&amp;rsquo;s data is almost a crusade for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google has never had qualms about mining people&amp;rsquo;s data to sell advertising, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never had a huge problem with this. Probably because I&amp;rsquo;ve come to believe Google&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t be evil&amp;rdquo; mantra after using their services for such a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, most of Google&amp;rsquo;s apps work beautifully on the iPhone - it seems pretty obvious that they don&amp;rsquo;t care whether you buy an Android phone or iPhone, as long as you use their services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple&amp;rsquo;s beautiful hardware is one of the main reasons that people are willing to kill a whole pay cheque on an iPhone. The 6s is indeed a thing of beauty and is often imitated, sometimes to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theverge.com/2015/10/27/9620318/htc-one-a9-review-android-iphone&#34;&gt;a ridiculous degree&lt;/a&gt;. Looking back, I had &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordbit.com/posts/one-month-till-iphone-gets-here/&#34;&gt;my eye on the original iPhone&lt;/a&gt; before it even debuted - but for some reason, I stuck with my flip phone for another five years before trying out an Android phone as my first smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it was with great excitement that I unboxed my first iPhone. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even turn it on until I&amp;rsquo;d put a screen protector on it and inserted a new SIM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, my heart broke a little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spotted a dead pixel in the lower-right corner of the screen. As you may know, once you see a dead pixel, you just can&amp;rsquo;t un-see it. Especially when you just paid $1200 for a phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took it into the Apple store the next day and they were willing to exchange it for a refurbished &amp;ldquo;service phone&amp;rdquo;, not a new out-of-the-box phone. Note-to-self: If I ever buy another Apple product, just get it at the store - not online. Apple stores can&amp;rsquo;t exchange online purchases. My choices were to either return it for a service phone, or mail the phone back to Apple and wait a couple of weeks for a new replacement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, after some deliberation - involving a bizarre rambling monologue from a disgruntled Genius - a third option presented itself: to replace the entire LCD screen. So that&amp;rsquo;s what I did - they could replace it at the store and it only took about an hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After using my new phone for a week, I&amp;rsquo;ve been pleasantly surprised at how well the iPhone syncs up my other Apple products - namely my iMac, iPad, and Apple TV. I&amp;rsquo;d never really considered this, but, until now, the iPhone was the only missing link in my personal Apple ecosystem (my second-gen iPod has long since ceased to be a contributing member of &amp;ldquo;the family&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could go on about how crispy the screen is or how insanely fast this thing is, but others have done so &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.anandtech.com/show/9686/the-apple-iphone-6s-and-iphone-6s-plus-review&#34;&gt;in far more detail&lt;/a&gt;. But, yeah, this thing screams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, there have also been some unexpected, quite inexplicable niggles. The Alert volume, for example, is separate from the Ringtone volume, but can&amp;rsquo;t be changed in the settings menu. I think you can change the Alert volume by playing some music and adjusting its volume, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure - either way, not very user friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I&amp;rsquo;m baffled as to how I can back up my videos in their original resolution. Photostream uploads photos to the cloud, but not videos. And trying to use Dropbox to back up photos and videos doesn&amp;rsquo;t work either because Apple doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow Dropbox to run indefinitely in the background. Google photos does a good job, but downscales 4K videos to 1080p.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, these are minor concerns that could someday be fixed in software. At the end of the day, a phone is just a tool. I know I&amp;rsquo;ve made a big deal in this blog about my upgrade. And I expected to go be glued to my new phone the moment I got it - installing tons of apps and so on. But I haven&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, the iPhone has sort of faded away into the background. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a distractingly large screen. There are no widgets to fiddle with. But when called on to perform a task - it is on point; the iPhone does it well and it does it fast. Like a well-oiled weapon that never misfires - the iPhone can be counted on when you need it most.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Work update</title>
      <link>http://wordbit.com/posts/work-update/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Nov 2015 18:49:22 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://wordbit.com/posts/work-update/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I blog about work very sparely, and I think most people would agree that saying too much can lead into dangerous territory. So, I tend to avoid it unless I have something general to say that doesn&amp;rsquo;t touch on any work projects. But I would be remiss in my blogging duties not to mention that I have a new job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started working as a technical writer at Vtech seven years ago - here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordbit.com/posts/new-job/&#34;&gt;a post&lt;/a&gt; I wrote when I first got the job, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordbit.com/posts/what-i-do/&#34;&gt;another&lt;/a&gt; I wrote about a month in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vtech has been very good to me and the people there are great, but last month the time came for me to move on. I worked on some great projects and enjoyed becoming a somewhat accomplished User Interface designer. My last project was a touchscreen phone which I designed from scratch - largely on my own. Now that I&amp;rsquo;m no longer working there, perhaps I&amp;rsquo;ll write a post sometime about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, wanting to work closer to home, and learn some new skills, I accepted a job as the sole technical writer at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kongsbergmesotech.com/&#34;&gt;Kongsberg Mesotech&lt;/a&gt;. They&amp;rsquo;re a subsidiary of Kongsberg, a major defence contractor for Norway and a high-tech company with &lt;a href=&#34;http://200.kongsberg.com/&#34;&gt;a 200-year old history&lt;/a&gt;. I had to go through security clearance and sign an NDA, so I definitely won&amp;rsquo;t be talking about their projects here either, but I can say that I&amp;rsquo;m working primarily with underwater sonar systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m really liking it. The commute is a dream compared to the absolute grind I had before. And I still get to go on my thrice-weekly runs - this time off-street on the portion of the Trans-Canada Trail that runs through Port Coquitlam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started at Vtech, they&amp;rsquo;d never had a technical writer before, so it took a while to integrate myself into the product development cycle. My new company has also never had a technical writer before, but this time, I come armed with lots of experience and confidence (cause y&amp;rsquo;all know I&amp;rsquo;m a good writer, right? RIGHT?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The senior information developer in Norway has been very supportive and indeed, the documentation team has a ton of resources, such as style guides, templates, etc. I especially appreciate the international support here because I got absolutely no support from the Hong Kong documentation team at Vtech (that isn&amp;rsquo;t good or bad - it&amp;rsquo;s just the way it was - hence the pleasant surprise).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, I will be flying to Norway for a two-week training session before the end of the year. It will be hard to be away from my family for so long, but am happy to be making face-to-face contact with the Norway team and learning valuable skills to boot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What skills though? This might get a bit technical, so if you&amp;rsquo;re not a fellow technical writer, you can probably stop reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be migrating all legacy documentation to single-sourced structured DITA authoring. The XML editor I&amp;rsquo;ll be using is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ptc.com/product/arbortext/author/editor&#34;&gt;Arbortext&lt;/a&gt;. I don&amp;rsquo;t have much practical experience with DITA. Although, DITA was so hot in the technical writer world a few years back, so I did research into implementing it at Vtech. Ultimately, I decided the time investment and practical application wasn&amp;rsquo;t worth it. This time, I hope things go better - and I will have more training and support of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Kongsberg uses the Simplified Technical English (STE) standard from the Aerospace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD). I have to say though, that their guidelines do not bleed over at all into user interface design because &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.asd-ste100.org/&#34;&gt;their website&lt;/a&gt; is absolutely horrid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, a steep learning curve, but lots of structure in place, which is fantastic. Additional areas I could push for training is photography and 3D modelling because the resources for manual illustrations aren&amp;rsquo;t so great. But I have enough on my plate for now - and that&amp;rsquo;s all you could ask for in your job, really - to be happily occupied. I do love my job and sometimes a change is just what you need to re-energize your career.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Banned for blogging about Apple</title>
      <link>http://wordbit.com/posts/banned-for-blogging-about-apple/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 27 Oct 2015 21:28:22 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://wordbit.com/posts/banned-for-blogging-about-apple/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Seeing as I don’t make any money off this blog, I try to keep costs down to a minimum. And so, for the past eight years or so, I’ve had no problems using a free web host to manage my self-hosted Wordpress installation. Until now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been pretty busy these days (for reasons which I’ll explain in a later post). But, wanting to post at least once a month, I navigated over to wordbit.com only to discover an ugly 403 error page instead of my home page.  So, I contacted my web host support. This is what happened:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://wordbit.com/images/appleban_scnsht_1.png&#34; alt=&#34;screen shot 1&#34; title=&#34;Screenshot 1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seemed pretty obvious to me by this point that the web host wanted to purge itself of all free-loaders, even if it meant making up minor infractions. But since I&amp;rsquo;d never used any of the listed forbidden words, I figured I had half a leg to stand on. I was wrong:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://wordbit.com/images/appleban_scnsht_2.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screen shot 2&#34; title=&#34;Screenshot 2&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guilty as charged - yes, I blog about Apple. And now I&amp;rsquo;d been banned for blogging about Apple. I&amp;rsquo;d say the whole debacle was asinine and petty, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t even begin to address the irony of being banned for blogging about the biggest technology giant on planet Earth. My good buddy Steven probably decided he&amp;rsquo;d had enough of subverting service requests into sales. So he checked which word appears on my blog with the highest frequency and magically turned it into a forbidden word. Even though I&amp;rsquo;ve never even come close to &amp;ldquo;abusing&amp;rdquo; the service these past few years, I was now labelled a deviant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, I pulled the plug on the web host faster than you can say &amp;ldquo;Apple&amp;rdquo; and looked for a new home. I briefly considered Medium, but find their intentions for monetization hazy at best. And they only offer custom domain names by invitation. I thought seriously about moving to wordpress.com, but they have advertising now apparently. And no custom domain name, so that would mean hosting a launcher page somewhere else anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The obvious and easy solution would have been to move to another free web host, but honestly, I&amp;rsquo;ve had enough. The internet at large has turned hostile toward bloggers. And I’m not just talking about the role social media has played in killing the blog. I think a lot of web hosts are setting fire to users who refuse to convert to paying customers. I also don&amp;rsquo;t want to deal with censorship ever again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this deliberation lead me to a hosting solution I&amp;rsquo;d seen a lot of software developers use - GitHub. Specifically &lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com&#34;&gt;GitHub pages&lt;/a&gt;. By checking files into a repository, content management mimics software version control. Without a doubt, the most popular static site generator out there is Jeckyll. Quick primer on static site generators - Basically, they compile all blog posts into a static html webpage instead of using runtimes like PHP and a database like MySQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eliminating database calls makes the site lightning fast on the front end with page loads being virtually non-existent. But you still have to deploy the entire site each time you add a new blog post. Apparently Jeckyll isn’t the fastest. I wanted speed on the back end too, so decided on &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;, which is snappy front and back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m no software geek, so it was a tough weekend for me - learning the terminal command line; running Python and Perl scripts; setting up virtual machines; figuring out how cloning, branching, committing, etc. work in GitHub; finding the perfect Hugo template; and converting my Wordpress posts to markdown. Learning to write in markdown has turned out to be simply a delight. Well done, &lt;a href=&#34;https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&#34;&gt;Gruber&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I eventually got it to work. And it&amp;rsquo;s really great. The setup I have now is exactly what I wanted - minimalist, clean, and upholding the old-school hacker ethos of the web. I&amp;rsquo;ll have to undergo a gradual cleanup effort to smooth out formatting issues resulting from the conversion from XML to markdown, and fix all image links too. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve danced this dance before over the years as my content has moved around a lot - more than I&amp;rsquo;d like. Hopefully this time I&amp;rsquo;ve found a home where I can stay for a while. One where I won&amp;rsquo;t ever be censored for, I don’t know, blogging about topics every single other person in the world blogs about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, thank you Steven. You’ve forced me to learn new things and expand my skillset. Without you, I’d still be wrangling with Wordpress and using your dodgy control panel. Thank you for the nostalgia - going back to the command line is like returning home to DOS. And thank you for giving me that aura of cool that comes to those who are crazy enough to hack together a blog on GitHub. I still have no idea what I’m doing, but I’m happier now, Steven, much happier.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2015 Flagship 4: iPhone 6S</title>
      <link>http://wordbit.com/posts/2015-flagship-4-iphone-6s/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 25 Sep 2015 21:47:22 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://wordbit.com/posts/2015-flagship-4-iphone-6s/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://wordbit.com/images/iphone6s.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;iphone6s&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I alluded to in my last post, the very definition of a &amp;ldquo;flagship&amp;rdquo; has perceptively shifted this past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, mid-range devices with high-end specs and razor-thin profit margins have exploded out of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the definition of a flagship has skewed heavily toward &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; phones (formerly known as phablets, but now the norm). Bigger phones tend to get better battery life and are able to fit in better camera components, such as Optical Image Stabilization (OIS).  But, I most certainly do not want a big phone. For me, the sweet spot is in the 4.5 to 5-inch screen size range. For this reason, I&amp;rsquo;m excluding phones like the Note 5 and iPhone 6S Plus from my overview of the year&amp;rsquo;s best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when all is said and done, a flagship choice always comes down to that most ancient and hotly disputed divide - Android or iPhone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple&amp;rsquo;s latest entry in the flagship wars, the iPhone 6S, comes as no surprise. Dependably meticulous manufacturing. A two-year design cycle. And so many leaks before the official announcement that the only real surprise this year was a unique take on the &amp;ldquo;selfie flash&amp;rdquo; where the whole front screen lights up. Let&amp;rsquo;s not forget the predictably glowing reviews as well. For the upper middle-class of the developed world, the iPhone is the only choice there is. It is, for better or worse, America&amp;rsquo;s phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite Apple not playing the spec game, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look anyway for the sake of consistency:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operating system:&lt;/strong&gt; iOS 9&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Display:&lt;/strong&gt; 4.7-inch 1334 x 750 pixel IPS LCD display, 326 ppi pixel density&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processor:&lt;/strong&gt; 1.85 Ghz 64-bit A9 SoC with M9 motion co-processor&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory:&lt;/strong&gt; 2GB RAM / 16GB, 64GB, and 128GB storage&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rear camera:&lt;/strong&gt; 12MP rear iSight camera, F2.2 lens, True Tone flash&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Front-facing camera:&lt;/strong&gt; 5MP front-facing FaceTime camera, Retina flash&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Battery:&lt;/strong&gt; 1715 mAh non-removable Li-ion battery&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size:&lt;/strong&gt; 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1mm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weight:&lt;/strong&gt; 143 grams&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Objectively speaking, the advantages of the iPhone are obvious. End-to-end control allows Apple to pursue a deep integration of hardware and software. This control has allowed intriguing new features, such as &amp;ldquo;3D Touch&amp;rdquo; where the screen measures different levels of pressure to activate &amp;ldquo;right-click&amp;rdquo; types of UI popups. This control allows Apple to get away with fairly middling specs, where Android phones are overcompensating with killer specs to cover a lack of optimization. This control is also what makes the iPhone camera usually so much better than the competition. I say &amp;ldquo;usually&amp;rdquo; because this year, the other guys, especially Samsung, have seriously stepped up their game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I do suspect that the Android implementation is only as good as its skin. In other words, the camera is great as long as you stay locked onto TouchWiz or Sense. We all know that manufacturer Android updates are agonizingly slow and in some cases, only supported for a year or two. Flash a custom ROM like Cyanogenmod, and you can kiss your tight hardware-software camera integration goodbye. I know this from bitter experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disadvantages of such tight control is that it can be stifling. There is a liberating feel to Android. The possibilities are endless when it comes to true customization, both on the front end and back end. Most Android phone manufacturers also aren&amp;rsquo;t afraid to explore the bleeding edge of hardware development. After all, they just leave the bulk of software development to Google, so hardly need to expend resources on it at all. Instead we get things like NFC (Android first) and 4K screens (Android first). Apple waits a while before coming up with a carefully considered rebuttal. But they are never first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I haven&amp;rsquo;t actually said much about the new iPhones, mostly because I don&amp;rsquo;t have to. The reviews are in - they&amp;rsquo;re great. No surprises there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if there will be any more flagships this year, so this most likely concludes my survey of the year&amp;rsquo;s best. The new Nexus phones are being announced next week, so I&amp;rsquo;ll definitely be checking those out. But, I&amp;rsquo;m not holding my breath for anything in the flagship class. I&amp;rsquo;ve got some thinking to do, because it&amp;rsquo;s finally time to make a choice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A long, dry summer</title>
      <link>http://wordbit.com/posts/a-long-dry-summer/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 26 Aug 2015 22:16:29 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://wordbit.com/posts/a-long-dry-summer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a long, dry summer - and I&amp;rsquo;m not just talking about the weather. My series on flagship phones has been somewhat stymied by some recent changes in the industry. I was expecting some more flagships to emerge from big boys like Sony and Motorola, but instead there has been a surge of mid-range devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After finding all their money was being made on the entry-level Moto G, Motorola decided to scale back on an ambitious successor to last year&amp;rsquo;s Moto X.  Instead we have the Moto X Play, which is nothing more than a pumped-up version of the Moto G with mid-range specs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, after struggling to make an impact in North America, despite a worthy flagship in the Xperia series, Sony has decided to limit the release of the Xperia Z4 to it&amp;rsquo;s native Japan only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, a bunch of Chinese companies are trying to change the game by releasing cheap Android phones with impressive specs. We&amp;rsquo;ve got Asus putting out the ZenFone 2, Alcatel&amp;rsquo;s OneTouch Idol 3, Xiaomi&amp;rsquo;s Redmi Note 2, and the so called &amp;ldquo;flagship killer&amp;rdquo;, the OnePlus 2. However, all these phones cut corners to get prices so low, and sometimes &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theverge.com/2015/8/13/9147211/android-price-wars-cost-of-cheap-smartphones&#34;&gt;the compromises aren&amp;rsquo;t worth it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what happened to the flagships? Well, it certainly doesn&amp;rsquo;t help that Apple is taking over 90 percent of all profits in the smartphone industry. That only leaves one option - make profit on sheer volume alone. But moving as many units as possible, especially in developing markets, means putting an ever downward pressure on prices. This sounds great in theory, especially since you can&amp;rsquo;t call these new mid-range phones cheap junk. The pace of technological advancement for phones lately has been blistering. A mid-range phone in 2015 makes last year&amp;rsquo;s flagship look positively vintage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So maybe the very concept of a flagship is becoming obsolete? It&amp;rsquo;s too soon to tell. There&amp;rsquo;s no doubt that the iPhone is an overpriced luxury item, despite being a beautifully manufactured product. But with most wireless carriers doing away with contracts and subsidies, customers are only now being exposed to the true price of a smartphone. Will people stick with the quality and superior customer service that Apple represents, despite the much higher price tag, or will a better bang-for-your-buck win in the end?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The year isn&amp;rsquo;t close to being over yet, so I may eat these words later&amp;hellip; but when it comes to true high-end flagships, it&amp;rsquo;s starting to look the same as in years past: a two-horse race between Apple and Samsung. And you know how I feel about Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;
