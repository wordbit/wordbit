          <p>We recently went on one of those all-inclusive vacations to Puerto Aventuras, Mexico (South of Cancun on the Mayan Riviera). It was out first time doing the all-inclusive thing, but we were suitably impressed. The weather was fantastic and the food was great. The only bad thing that happened was that I lost half my tooth when I bit into a seed in a fruit of foreign extraction. I didn&rsquo;t let it stop me though and just chewed on the right side of my mouth. I wasn&rsquo;t about to visit the dentist in Mexico anyway. We relaxed mostly, snorkelled, rode on a catamaran, went biking, and ate tons of food. We also visited a great beach called X-bu-ha? or something like that. I&rsquo;ll show you guys some video later on when I get round to editing it. Here are a few pics of our resort.</p>
