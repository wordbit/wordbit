          <p>The first entry of 2009! Granted, this isn&rsquo;t the most updated blog in the world, but I&rsquo;ve managed to keep wordbit going for around two years now, which is not bad. I recently tried to find the oldest blog in the world, and <a href="http://www.netfunny.com/rhf/oldest-blog.html">this site</a> claims to have been blogging since 1987. But that&rsquo;s just their opinion - blogs in their modern incarnation haven&rsquo;t been around for more than about 10 years.</p>

<p>Well, I&rsquo;d like to wrap up 2008 on a personal note and let you know what&rsquo;s been going on in my life - besides from recently getting engaged, which I&rsquo;m really excited about. <img src="/images/is9181.jpg" alt="is9181" /></p>

<p>On the work side of things, I recently extended my contract at Vtech by another 6 months. I asked for more money, which they were happy to give me. It&rsquo;s been a great experience no matter what happens. I&rsquo;ve been working primarily on a business phone system, but have also helped out with the Internal Product Specification (IPS) for an internet radio, which I quite enjoyed. This product recently made its debut at CES and was <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/01/06/vtech-plunges-into-home-audio-market-with-is9181-wifi-radio/">reviewed on Engadget</a>. It&rsquo;s nice to be able to finally talk about this stuff! I have one at my desk and really enjoy it - I can totally recommend this nifty little device. The guys put a lot of love into this one.</p>
