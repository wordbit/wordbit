          <p>Wordbit has been down for the count for a few days due to an experimental  Google app I unwisely installed. So, just in case you were thinking of trying out one of the apps in Google Labs, think again.</p>

<p><img align="left" style="border:20px solid white" src="/images/googleaccelarator%5B9%5D.gif"></p>

<p>Google Accelerator ostensibly speeds up your Internet browsing by diverting web pages through their servers. The problem is that the program pre-fetches all websites on any given page. This is fine for public browsing at, say, a library. For website administration pages, it opens the doors to hell. Every option on the page will be pre-fetched by Google, including links to delete posts or change the language options, or whatever. When I discovered that Google Accelerator was messing up my Wordpress Administration page to the point where I couldn&rsquo;t click on anything without it going haywire, I hastily uninstalled it. In doing so, Google Accelerator took my entire website with it. Thankfully, I had recently made backups of my site (because I&rsquo;ve recently switched to a new server).</p>

<p>Anyway, to make a long story short, in the end I had to delete everything and redirect my nameservers to fix the problem! So, everything should be back to normal now.</p>

<p>I think I trusted too much in Google because I&rsquo;ve always loved everything they&rsquo;ve put out there. This particular app, however, should go straight to Google&rsquo;s recycle bin.</p>
