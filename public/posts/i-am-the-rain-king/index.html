          <p>Woke up this morning to a rabid thunderstorm and relentless rain, stumbled outside half asleep to find the street had turned into a river, complete with refuse and unidentifiable small furry animals floating in it&rsquo;s murky currents. If I&rsquo;d bother to watch the news more often I would have seen that some typhoon by the Japanese islands is causing all this mayhem. Anyways, got to work muddy and furious and exhausted then had a really bad day&hellip; The &lsquo;Kittens&rsquo; tore me apart, it was like that scene in Jurassic park where the fat traitorous guy falls in the mud and has hundreds of cute little dinosaurs swarming all over him eating him alive. And then I started getting really annoyed by the bad moods of other people and I tried to do my lesson plans but my brain failed to operate, so I just had to leave my work on my desk and make a desperate escape from the office. I wish I could politely pull people to one side like they do in the movies, &ldquo;Excuse me, may I have a word&rdquo; then patiently and eloquently explain exactly why they have offended me and demand retribution, but unfortunately the potential conflict just isn&rsquo;t worth the honesty. Sigh. What a horrifically superficial world we live in.</p>
