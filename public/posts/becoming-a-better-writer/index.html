          <p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to articulate to myself why most writing on the internet leaves me feeling hollow - my own writing included. In doing so, I&rsquo;ve had to look beyond the mechanics of writing. Certainly, good writers use words judiciously and move beyond pure grammatical correctness to craft a personal style and weave a sense of play into their prose. But what&rsquo;s missing is a piece of the soul.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t mean soul in the spiritual sense, although there is certainly a place for that in the literary ethos. When we say writing is &ldquo;raw&rdquo; and &ldquo;uncensored&rdquo;, I think we&rsquo;re getting closer. To be raw is to be naked in a sense - to be vulnerable. To expose the human part of yourself is to invite criticism and also pain. I think - I know - most writers are afraid to do this, but we are all left bereft as a result. The top-ranking blogs today feed us with endless rumours and breaking news in a sparse journalistic style easily digested. But news junkies are never fully satiated. We joke at the sort of banality rampant in those &ldquo;what I ate for lunch&rdquo; tweets, but them tweet the same after we realize Twitter is too shallow a medium to do say much else. Thoughtful analysis is reserved for long-form magazine pieces, but even this art eschews the personality of the author.</p>

<p>Perhaps I am lamenting the demise of the personal blog. I think that is partly right. But I also hope that the internet will foster more creativity, rather than submit to the lowest common denominator. There is hope in sites like <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a> and <a href="http://www.wattpad.com">Wattpad</a>, and I am also surprised in how insightful <a href="http://www.quora.com/">Quora</a> can be. But I&rsquo;m concerned at how top-heavy these sites are becoming, with well-established players being promoted to the top and simply publishing free content as a marketing ploy rather than a true attempt to connect with a readership.</p>

<p>I guess the question now is, can I become more real in my writing, and in doing so become a &ldquo;better&rdquo; writer? The truth is, I don&rsquo;t know. To write is more of a struggle for writers than for anybody. And I struggle a lot. Maybe the only way to find out is to just keep putting one word in front of another.</p>
