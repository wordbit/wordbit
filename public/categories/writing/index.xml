&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alive.com/lifestyle/no-rest-for-the-dead-battery/&#34;&gt;recent article&lt;/a&gt; on Battery Recycling is now available in the November issue of &lt;em&gt;alive&lt;/em&gt;. I wasn’t aware of this before researching this topic, but you can recycle both single-use and rechargeable batteries in British Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I’m a big fan of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eneloop.info/&#34;&gt;eneloop batteries&lt;/a&gt;. I believe the batteries Apple uses in their wireless mouse and keyboard are re-branded eneloops.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alive.com/lifestyle/cell-tower-invasion/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://wordbit.com/images/cellinvasion1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;cellinvasion1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alive.com/lifestyle/going-all-the-way/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://wordbit.com/images/baldness1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;baldness1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some new articles of mine that were published in &lt;em&gt;alive&lt;/em&gt; magazine. Click on the thumbnails to view them. The first is on whether cell phone towers are safe or not. There is much heated debate surrounding this issue and I got a lot of hate mail for even suggesting we don’t know all there is to know about the technology. The hard truth is that we just don’t have the data spanning a human lifetime to say one way or the other, so lay off haters! My second article is less controversial – should you shave your head when going bald (yes). This was a fun article to write and I got to interview P. Diddy’s barber in Hollywood. Really nice guy. The art guy is an avid surfer so the appearance of Kelly Slater as the bald hunk poster boy is no surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>It pays to be paranoid</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://wordbit.freehostia.com/scans/Avoidingcoldandflu2010.html&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/candf20100001.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;candf20100001&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; As 2010 hits in full force I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of ways to schedule in more quality blog time and keep wordbit alive. In the meantime, here is my latest article on how to avoid cold and flu germs. I don&amp;rsquo;t know about you but I&amp;rsquo;ve run the germ gambit from Swine to March Madness varieties and I&amp;rsquo;ve had enough. So it&amp;rsquo;s apt then that my article recommends borderline conspiracy theory-fueled paranoid behaviour to avoid catching a sniffle.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cheap winter thrills</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://wordbit.freehostia.com/scans/winterthrills.html&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/winterrthrills198web.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;winterrthrills198web&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; So, you&amp;rsquo;ve done all your Christmas shopping, and maybe scored a few deals by reading my last blog post. Now you want to have some fun in the snow but the rocky economic climate is scaring you off the slopes. Continuing on the theme of thrifty spending, check out my latest article on finding deals on winter sports equipment (while being eco-savvy at the same time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed writing this article because, well, I&amp;rsquo;m a SME when it comes to being cheap. Let&amp;rsquo;s just say that being a student has taught me how to stretch every dollar. And my hefty student loans will ensure the continuation of my pauper-like existence for some time to come!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Surf&#39;s up - and so is your heart rate</title>
      <link>http://wordbit.com/posts/surfs-up-and-so-is-your-heart-rate/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://wordbit.freehostia.com/scans/SurfingNov08.html&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/surfing194.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;surfing194&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; That&amp;rsquo;s probably the cheesiest line I&amp;rsquo;ve ever written. But for some reason, the editors over at &lt;em&gt;alive&lt;/em&gt; actually seem to revel in cheese (One example is the title I&amp;rsquo;ll eternally shake my head at: &lt;em&gt;G&amp;hellip;I can&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s a Glycemic index&lt;/em&gt;). God bless &amp;lsquo;em though - they&amp;rsquo;re a wonderful bunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here&amp;rsquo;s an article I really enjoyed writing because, well, I love surfing! And so does Scott over in the art department. He took some glorious pictures in Tofino and quite simply graced my article with them. Click on the thumbnail to hit the beach dude.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Have a laugh, have a cry</title>
      <link>http://wordbit.com/posts/have-a-laugh-have-a-cry/</link>

      <guid>http://wordbit.com/posts/have-a-laugh-have-a-cry/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here are some recent article shorts. As usual, you can click on the thumbnails to read them. The one on the left is a feel-good piece on laughter yoga. The right piece touches on the depressing psychological and cultural effects of global warming. There&amp;rsquo;s also a teeny one in there on the dodgy air we have to breathe in airplanes (even Purell won&amp;rsquo;t save you this time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://wordbit.freehostia.com/scans/laughteryoga.html&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/yoga192.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;yoga192&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordbit.freehostia.com/scans/greenlivingnov08.html&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/green%20living193.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;green living193&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing these two articles juxtaposed like this evokes a stark contrast between Western frivolity and Aboriginal reality. Note how they&amp;rsquo;re both sitting in the same cross-legged position too. I almost wish the art department had actually planned it that way.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Want to write for Wired?</title>
      <link>http://wordbit.com/posts/want-to-write-for-wired/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 26 Oct 2008 01:25:31 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://wordbit.com/posts/want-to-write-for-wired/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wired magazine has some interesting pieces this month. Well, every month is pretty good, but writers might appreciate &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.wired.com/storyboard/&#34;&gt;this behind-the-scenes look&lt;/a&gt; at how an article is assigned, written, edited, and designed. You can read the email correspondence between author and editor, and get an idea of how to pitch your story idea to a magazine. Great stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/ff_manuals7_f.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ff_manuals7_f&#34; /&gt; Also, technical writers might get a kick out of this &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wired.com/culture/design/multimedia/2008/10/ff_manuals&#34;&gt;photo essay of classic instruction manuals&lt;/a&gt;. What I found interesting was what Dan Winters, the photographer who compiled these, had to say: &amp;ldquo;I actually think that modern manuals are unreadable,&amp;rdquo; Winters says. &amp;ldquo;Visually speaking, they probably peaked in the &amp;lsquo;30s.&amp;rdquo; What rot. Seriously - is this guy part of the MTV generation or something? End-user documentation has never been cleaner and easier to understand. In fact, most help is migrating to interactive web-based apps that even a child would coo at. I understand he&amp;rsquo;s speaking as a visually-biased photographer - not a writer, but the overly intricate diagrams in his photo essay (as cool as they are in a retro sort of way) hardly represent the peak of information architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Recycling, global warming, and toxic toys</title>
      <link>http://wordbit.com/posts/recycling-global-warming-and-toxic-toys/</link>

      <guid>http://wordbit.com/posts/recycling-global-warming-and-toxic-toys/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t blogged in a while, and as Uncle Argyle says &amp;ldquo;Well that&amp;rsquo;s something we shall have to remedy, isn&amp;rsquo;t it&amp;rdquo; (That quote is from &lt;em&gt;Braveheart&lt;/em&gt;, just in case you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen one of the greatest movies ever made). Unfortunately I&amp;rsquo;m keeping it short today - here are two of my articles from &lt;em&gt;alive&lt;/em&gt; magazine&amp;rsquo;s July and August issues respectively. Click on the thumbnails to view them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://wordbit.freehostia.com/scans/GreenlivingJuly2008.html&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/July2008short.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;July2008short&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://wordbit.freehostia.com/scans/Recycling.html&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/bluebox1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bluebox1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[](&lt;a href=&#34;http://wordbit.freehostia.com/scans/Recycling.html&#34;&gt;http://wordbit.freehostia.com/scans/Recycling.html&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first article is a couple of shorts on the nine most vulnerable areas on planet Earth and toxic toys. The second is an article on why recycling religiously doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily make you a saint.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Professional writers online</title>
      <link>http://wordbit.com/posts/professional-writers-online/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2008 04:30:03 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://wordbit.com/posts/professional-writers-online/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/exploring.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/exploring_thumb.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;exploring&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s been about four months since my classmates and I graduated from the Print Futures Professional Writing Program. If you&amp;rsquo;re serious about your craft and are thinking of attending this two-year diploma program, I heartily encourage you to go for it. I love to write and I love getting paid to do it even more. But don&amp;rsquo;t kid yourself - writing well works up a mental sweat for every writer, whether oozing with talent or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I&amp;rsquo;d acknowledge some of my graduated colleagues who have websites online. The reason most of the sites on the list below are not on my blogroll is because they&amp;rsquo;re static pages. In other words, they&amp;rsquo;re not regularly updated - which is a little unfortunate in my opinion because I love to read what people are up to in the minutiae of their lives and enjoy reading the blogs of people I know. I almost never check in with static pages. Facebook&amp;rsquo;s great, but is more like a sophisticated telegraphing machine than a home you can personalize and make your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a Print Futures Grad and have a blog or regularly updated site that&amp;rsquo;s not on this list, please let me know - I&amp;rsquo;d love to add you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In no particular order:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Josie Padro: &lt;a href=&#34;http://theprobe.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;The Probe&lt;/a&gt; is Josie&amp;rsquo;s blog.&lt;br /&gt;
Current position: Freelance writer (&lt;em&gt;alive&lt;/em&gt;, Vancouverplus).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shawn Klemmer: You can find Shawn at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wildgrass.ca/&#34;&gt;Wildgrass Communications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Current position: Public Relations Officer at the Xa:ytem Longhouse Interpretive Centre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pamela Findling: Pamela&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pamelafindling.com/&#34;&gt;portfolio website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Current position: Communications Coordinator at Science World (Telus World of Science).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Lee: James&amp;rsquo; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www3.telus.net/jl/&#34;&gt;portfolio website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Current position: Procedures Analyst at Central 1 Credit Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laura Kelsey: personal &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.laurakelsey.com/&#34;&gt;portfolio website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Current position: Editor of 100 Mile House Free Press.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nicole Skutelnik: personal &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nicoleskutelnik.com/&#34;&gt;portfolio website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Current position: Novelist (children&amp;rsquo;s lit).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nissa Wells: personal &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nissawells.com/&#34;&gt;portfolio website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Current position: Online editor for Tactics Magazine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Denis Orellana: You can find Denis at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dmowriting.com/&#34;&gt;DMO Writing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Current position: Editor of E.GO Magazine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kai Jansson: Personal &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kaijansson.com/&#34;&gt;site and blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Current position: Copy editor at Stockwatch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These aren&amp;rsquo;t all the people I graduated with, but the others don&amp;rsquo;t have an online presence. Shockingly, there are people in this world who don&amp;rsquo;t spend all their time on the net!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The writer&#39;s bane is...writing</title>
      <link>http://wordbit.com/posts/the-writers-bane-iswriting/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2008 02:33:02 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://wordbit.com/posts/the-writers-bane-iswriting/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/bird.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bird&#34; /&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve just finished reading Anne Lamott&amp;rsquo;s B&lt;em&gt;ird by Bird&lt;/em&gt;, a wonderfully humourous book full of advice on how to write and how to overcome those challenges all writers face. Here&amp;rsquo;s an excerpt I particularly like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&#34;But how?&#34; my students ask. &#34;How do you actually do it?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; You sit down, I say. You try to sit down at approximately the same time every day. This is how you train your unconscious to kick in for you creatively. So you sit down at, say, nine every morning, or ten every night. You put a piece of paper in the typewriter, or you turn on your computer and bring up the right file, and then you stare at it for an hour or so. You begin rocking, just a little at first, and then like a huge autistic child. You look at the ceiling, and over at the clock, yawn, and stare at the paper again. 
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Then, with your fingers poised on the keyboard, you squint at an image that is forming in your mind - a scene, a locale, a character, whatever - and you try to quiet your mind so you can hear what that landscape has to say above the other voices in your mind. The other voices are banshees and drunken monkeys. They are the voices of anxiety, judgment, doom, guilt. Also, severe hypochondria. There may be a Nurse Ratched-like listing of things that must be done right this moment: foods that must come out of the freezer, appointments that must be canceled or made, hairs that must be tweezed. But you hold an imaginary gun to your head and make yourself stay at the desk. There is a vague pain at the base of your neck. It crosses your mind that you have meningitis. Then the phone rings and you look up at the ceiling with fury, summon every ounce of noblesse oblige, and answer the call politely, with maybe just the merest hint of irritation. The caller asks if you&#39;re working, and you say yeah, because you are.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sound familiar? The hardest part about writing is definitely the writing part. Anyway, just wanted to share that with you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ultimate relaxation techniques</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/eli.png&#34; alt=&#34;eli&#34; /&gt; The May edition of &lt;em&gt;alive&lt;/em&gt; magazine is out, and I have two articles published in it this month. A few months ago I interviewed stress guru &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.elibay.com&#34;&gt;Eli Bay&lt;/a&gt; about his relaxation techniques. Take a deep breath, relax for a few minutes and &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordbit.freehostia.com/scans/EBayInterview.html&#34;&gt;read his insights&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/mosquito.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;mosquito&#34; /&gt;I also wrote a short piece on &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordbit.freehostia.com/scans/Mosquito%20article.html&#34;&gt;the rise of the mosquito population&lt;/a&gt; in our new era of rising temperatures. Mosquitoes love warm, moist climates, and they&amp;rsquo;re getting a lot of that these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of the rest of this week, I expect to be blogging exclusively on DocTrain West, which I&amp;rsquo;m attending this week.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is Brijit liberating or enslaving?</title>
      <link>http://wordbit.com/posts/is-brijit-liberating-or-enslaving/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2008 17:10:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://wordbit.com/posts/is-brijit-liberating-or-enslaving/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/briji.gif&#34; alt=&#34;briji&#34; /&gt; For those of you who aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar with it, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.brijit.com/&#34;&gt;Brijit&lt;/a&gt; is a website that publishes 100-word summaries of various web, TV, radio, and print media. The idea is that there is so much information out there - wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be nice if we had the short-short version so we can get the gist of it and decide if it&amp;rsquo;s worth reading or watching the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a neat idea, but with so much content out there, it would be impossible for an editorial team to cover it all. Brijit came up with the genius idea of asking anybody to submit these 100-word summaries in exchange for $5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let&amp;rsquo;s get this straight. Five buck for a hundred words works out to a paltry five cents a word. Top freelance rates in Canada hover at around a buck a word, and even that is pathetic. Most writers settle for around 50 cents a word, which is still ten times as much as Brijit is offering. I would assume that no serious writer would even consider working for pea&amp;hellip;oh wait, I think even peanuts are worth more than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sad thing is that the writing on Brijit is actually &lt;em&gt;quite good&lt;/em&gt;. Are there people desperate enough to spend an hour or two reading an article and then capturing the essence of it in a 100 words? It may sound simple, but it takes far longer than you&amp;rsquo;d think to do it right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brijit ups the ante by submitting each requisition to competition - you actually have to compete with three other writers in the hopes that your piece gets chosen. So most times you just end up writing your beautifully crafted cribs note for free. Competition, however, is a great motivator for some people apparently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is Brijit turning freelance writing into a cheap mockery? Is it dragging down freelance rates by calling anybody a writer? Can you even stomach reading summaries that you know were written by word slaves?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wordbit.freehostia.com/eportfolio&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/scshotweb.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;scshotweb&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve officially uploaded the latest version of my ePortolio - you can &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wordbit.freehostia.com/eportfolio&#34;&gt;check it out here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This website uses some flash elements and some fancy css coding and is basically geared towards technical writing employers as a way to showcase my work. I may expand it in the future to include other samples too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who are interested, I designed it in Dreamweaver, Illustrator, and Photoshop. I used FlashSpring Pro 2 to convert a Powerpoint to flash. It&amp;rsquo;s best viewed using the latest version of any browser with a resolution of 1024x768. It&amp;rsquo;s also a bit flashier than the portfolio on this blog, which includes everything, including the kitchen sink.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/Pearls%2027.png&#34; alt=&#34;Pearls 27&#34; /&gt; On Friday I had the pleasure of attending the 27th Pearls book launch, the annual anthology of creative writing works by Douglas College students. My story, &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordbitarchives.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/the-reluctant-teacher.pdf&#34;&gt;The Reluctant Teacher&lt;/a&gt;, was published in it this year. I&amp;rsquo;ve had some poetry published in Pearls before, but that was about 8 years ago, so it&amp;rsquo;s been a while. A few of the authors read by candlelight and I got to see a few familiar faces. Good times.&lt;/p&gt;
