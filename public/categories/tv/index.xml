      <description>You may be wondering if Iâ€™m talking about the book or the HBO series. Well, I read the book first, so the TV show paled in comparison, as is usually the case. I was optimistic at first, mostly because of the glowing reviews and comparisons to Lord of the Rings. Peter Jackson undoubtedly won the hearts of purists and lovingly captured the spirit of the books. Unfortunately, the Game of Thrones TV series falls short of this benchmark.</description>

      <description>I recently finished watching the complete Firefly series on Netflix. That sounds like a lot of TV watching, but it only ran for 14 episodes before it got cancelled due to low ratings. Most geeks agree, however, that this show was a little gem, was poorly marketed by Fox, and should never have died so early. After watching it, I would have to agree.
I guess this show falls into the space-western genre, and with plenty of horses, bandits, prostitutes, and bounty hunters, I&amp;rsquo;d say it falls more into the &amp;ldquo;western&amp;rdquo; part of the spectrum.</description>
