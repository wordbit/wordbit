      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been taking a long break from blogging, but have been swamped with other projects and personal stuff. But I thought I&amp;rsquo;d take this opportunity for a cool retrospective trip through the interwebs. Now, you may know that Yahoo&amp;rsquo;s Geocities is closing this October.
