      <description>You may as well recycle those newspaper classifieds, because that old school job-finding tool belongs in the 20th century. Spurred on by the recession, a number of tech-savvy people have started blogging on various &amp;ldquo;new school&amp;rdquo; ways of getting a job. Tech evangelist Robert Scoble has some crafty tips. I tend to agree with him when he says your blog is your résumé. After all, google my name and this blog is the first search result (and if you are a hiring manager, then please note my correct formatting of the word résumé!</description>

      <description>So the economy is caught in a perpetual flush cycle and the government is crumbling under the pressure of imminent deficits. You&amp;rsquo;re waiting for HR to ask you to stop by so they can talk about &amp;ldquo;restructuring&amp;rdquo;. You&amp;rsquo;re wondering if you can even afford to drive to the mall this holiday season, let alone buy mounds of stuff there. Well, no worries. Here are some resources for thrifty Canadians with the most meagre of budgets, because let&amp;rsquo;s face it - right now it&amp;rsquo;s cool to be cheap.</description>

      <title>Telemarketer&#39;s bane</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been almost a month since the launch of Canada&amp;rsquo;s National Do Not Call List. If you signed up on September 30th, your right to slam a deviant telemarketer will kick in this October 30th. Sweet. When will companies learn that people telemarketing is the second most hated form of privacy invasion on this planet (Door-to-door marketing holds the number one spot in my mind)? Even junk mail doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem as bad, as annoying as it is.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m going to start a series on finding a tech-writing job specifically in the high-tech hub of Vancouver, BC (which is where I happen to live). As I started the job search process myself, I noticed a dearth of information on this topic. I hope I can dig up some useful info for those in a similar position - eventually I&amp;rsquo;ll port this stuff over to my resources page.
So, without further ado, here is part 1, which will focus on job search engines.</description>

      <description>Get your science and techie news served up with a healthy dose of Brit witticisms. Check out The Register, a highly readable site out of the UK that dishes the sarcasm along with the geek factor.
Also, alive - in conjunction with The Good Life Network has just launched their podcast page. You can here my boss Terry-Lynn being interviewed by the silver-tongued Jesse Dylan at aliveonair.com.</description>
