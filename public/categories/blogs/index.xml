&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite blogs has to be Derek Miller&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.penmachine.com/&#34;&gt;Penmachine&lt;/a&gt;. I really enjoy this blog because Derek writes well and he writes often. Derek usually writes about technology, gadgets, software, and other geektastic topics. After getting cancer a year ago, however, his posts have been a lot more personal. He has unceasingly blogged about his harrowing experiences and shared every tear and every joy with his readers, writing in a straightforward, honest style. He recently redesigned his blog and made it a lot cleaner, using a lot of white space and an elegant simplicity (which I like).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another blog I enjoy reading is Tom Johnson&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.idratherbewriting.com/&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d Rather Be Writing&lt;/a&gt;. Tom is a tech writer who feeds his need to write by blogging on technical communication. He also runs a popular tech writing podcast. I like his blog because he writes clearly and is passionate about what he does. His website is also clean, with lots of white space and minimal clutter.&lt;/p&gt;
