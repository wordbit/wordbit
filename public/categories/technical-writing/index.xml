      <title>Get to know your technical writer</title>
      <link>http://wordbit.com/posts/get-to-know-your-technical-writer/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&#34;left&#34; style=&#34;border-right:40px solid white&#34; src=&#34;http://wordbit.com/images/hugs.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you work at a big hi-tech company and you have questions. Lots of questions. But your manager is in yet another meeting and your deadline is looming. Who do you turn to? Why, your friendly, neighbourhood technical writer of course. Here’s why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your technical writer may have written a 500 page manual on how your product works but you sure don’t have time to read that beast. Why not ask the author directly? Your technical writer probably knows more about the product than anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who is constantly interviewing marketing and upper management for the latest product definitions and behaviour? Not you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Quality Assurance finds a bug they don’t cross-check your code, they check out the documentation. Guess who wrote the documentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does your product spec give little insight into the user interface? Your technical writer thinks like a user. They do not think like you. Trust me on this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or maybe you have a really great idea for a product improvement but the thought of writing a proposal to the decision makers puts you off as much as writing an essay in English class did. Technical writers love writing essays. In fact, if they’re on-board with your idea you cannot find a better advocate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Two years is a long time…</title>
      <link>http://wordbit.com/posts/two-years-is-a-long-time/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&#34;left&#34; style=&#34;border:20px solid white&#34; src=&#34;http://wordbit.com/images/desksetpic_thumb.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be working on a project that is. At least it feels that way considering most writing projects I’ve been involved in are over after a hair-pulling night of throwing words onto a page or two. Project timelines are a bit more distended in the technical writing world. But, anyway, enough kerfuffle. What I’d like to present to you is the best business phone ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it’s the phone system I’ve been writing those 400-page Internal Product Specifications for. Synapse is basically a VoIP-based telephony network that integrates into an existing LAN network. What this means is that you don’t have to buy fifty phone lines because it runs over the internet. I won’t bore you with the details, so why don’t you take a look at &lt;a href=&#34;http://smbtelephones.att.com/smbui/store/video/att_synapse_demo.mov&#34;&gt;a promo video&lt;/a&gt; cooked up by the AT&amp;amp;T marketing guys (Quicktime). BTW, I also worked on the text in the User Interface (the display) and I can honestly say that this is the most user-friendly business phone you’ll ever use.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Eleven ways to sell technical writing</title>
      <link>http://wordbit.com/posts/eleven-ways-to-sell-technical-writing/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2008 05:54:32 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://wordbit.com/posts/eleven-ways-to-sell-technical-writing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&#34;left&#34; style=&#34;border:20px solid white&#34; src=&#34;http://wordbit.com/images/cubicle.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say eleven, because Ben Minson came up with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gryphonmountain.net/archives/techcomm/seven-reasons-your-company-needs-a-technical-communicator&#34;&gt;this excellent list&lt;/a&gt; of seven plus four more on his blog, Gryphon Mountain. His list gives reasons why a company should hire a technical writer. Check it out if you need to justify your existence or if nobody has fought through the cobwebs to your cubicle in a while and you suspect the engineering department has forgotten about you. Or maybe you need to explain what-it-is-you-do-exactly in a job interview. Here are his basic points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;End users need documentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical communicators look at the product with a user perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical communicators help with quality assurance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having quality documentation reflects positively on your organization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation provides a record.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation saves on support costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical writers have a versatile skill set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical communicators&amp;rsquo; information gathering gets the team to think critically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical communicators are specifically trained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical communicators lighten the load.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical communicators can provide training and support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree with all these points. The only thing I&amp;rsquo;d add is that the audience for technical documentation can be far more diverse than just the end user. Engineers, marketing managers, stakeholders, product testers, and just about everybody involved needs the goodies. Documentation is important at all levels of the production cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Want to write for Wired?</title>
      <link>http://wordbit.com/posts/want-to-write-for-wired/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 26 Oct 2008 01:25:31 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://wordbit.com/posts/want-to-write-for-wired/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wired magazine has some interesting pieces this month. Well, every month is pretty good, but writers might appreciate &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.wired.com/storyboard/&#34;&gt;this behind-the-scenes look&lt;/a&gt; at how an article is assigned, written, edited, and designed. You can read the email correspondence between author and editor, and get an idea of how to pitch your story idea to a magazine. Great stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&#34;left&#34; style=&#34;border:20px solid white&#34; src=&#34;http://wordbit.com/images/ff_manuals7_f.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, technical writers might get a kick out of this &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wired.com/culture/design/multimedia/2008/10/ff_manuals&#34;&gt;photo essay of classic instruction manuals&lt;/a&gt;. What I found interesting was what Dan Winters, the photographer who compiled these, had to say: &amp;ldquo;I actually think that modern manuals are unreadable,&amp;rdquo; Winters says. &amp;ldquo;Visually speaking, they probably peaked in the &amp;lsquo;30s.&amp;rdquo; What rot. Seriously - is this guy part of the MTV generation or something? End-user documentation has never been cleaner and easier to understand. In fact, most help is migrating to interactive web-based apps that even a child would coo at. I understand he&amp;rsquo;s speaking as a visually-biased photographer - not a writer, but the overly intricate diagrams in his photo essay (as cool as they are in a retro sort of way) hardly represent the peak of information architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Would you hire you?</title>
      <link>http://wordbit.com/posts/would-you-hire-you/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2008 05:01:32 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://wordbit.com/posts/would-you-hire-you/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&#34;left&#34; style=&#34;border:20px solid white&#34; src=&#34;http://wordbit.com/images/fired.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this rocky economic climate, marketing yourself has never been more crucial if you want to survive the inevitable cutbacks. When it comes to technical writing, it&amp;rsquo;s a useful exercise to understand and appreciate what companies look for in a writer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lyndsey Amott, in an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.docsymmetry.com/hiring-a-technical-writer.html&#34;&gt;article on her website&lt;/a&gt;, stresses that industry knowledge should not be a primary deciding factor when mulling over suitable candidates. Her top three must-haves are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1. design a document that looks good both on paper and on-line  
2. design a document that can be updated easily  
3. write instructions that are easy to understand
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She goes on to say that the proof of a good writer lies in the way they organize their thoughts and that inexperienced writers shouldn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily be dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technical writing consultant Jean Weber makes some good points in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jeanweber.com/newsite/?page_id=21&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;. She agrees that the writing is more important than the software or technical expertise. She advises companies to look for problem-solvers who keep digging until they find all the answers. But they should be somebody tactful, not abrasive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employers are always concerned with costs and staying on budget. If you can relay the value of creating relevant content in a specific context and to a specific audience, you&amp;rsquo;re on the right track. Remember that as a technical writer you&amp;rsquo;re the bridge between subject matter experts and the stakeholders, the marketers, and the end-users. Without you, knowledge could not be channeled into capital gain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you find your head on the chopping block, start thinking like your employer and ask yourself why they should keep you around. The answer could just save your neck.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What I do</title>
      <link>http://wordbit.com/posts/what-i-do/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2008 04:23:05 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://wordbit.com/posts/what-i-do/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&#34;left&#34; style=&#34;border:20px solid white&#34; src=&#34;http://wordbit.com/images/ph.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought it was high time for an update on the first two weeks of my contract. As I alluded to previously, the project I&amp;rsquo;m working on right now involves the design of a new phone. It&amp;rsquo;s a complex system with many components, and is rather hush-hush at the moment so I can&amp;rsquo;t really elaborate on it. Thus far, much of the system behaviour has been decided upon verbally, which is where I come in. Through interviews with the project manager and the software engineers, and by gleaning information from what is known as a state table (a map of the information architecture), I&amp;rsquo;ve been putting together engineering specifications for a product that does not exist yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal is to provide the engineers with a base line so that they can move forward with the design process. This means I&amp;rsquo;m also creating screenshots of what the man-machine interface (MMI) will ideally look like. I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing these in Photoshop, but there is talk of moving to a program called Axure, which offers a much richer functionality and the ability to create master modules (so that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to re-generate a hundred screenshots every time a small change in the MMI is made).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, it&amp;rsquo;s very interesting being involved at this stage of product development, although I was hoping to do some end-user documentation as well. At this point that looks doubtful as that&amp;rsquo;s the tech writer in Oregon&amp;rsquo;s baby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the work is a bit dry - for example, today I was determining how many characters to allocate a word for translation. The English interface has to be translated into French and Spanish, but there is a limited amount of pixels on the display screen on the phone, so I had to figure out how much wiggle room to allow the translators, in case their translation of &amp;ldquo;Answer&amp;rdquo;, for instance, turns out to be a five words long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company culture is quite rad - lots of barbeques and once a month there is a social with buckets of beer and an assortment of greasy food (no organic juice like at &lt;em&gt;alive&lt;/em&gt; unfortunately). In the lunch room is a sweet gaming setup -two widescreen hi-def TVs - one hooked up to an XBOX 360 and the other hooked up to a Wii. On the table sits a couple of Guitar Hero axes and steering wheel controllers. There&amp;rsquo;s also a pool table, ping-pong table, and foosball. Basically a geek&amp;rsquo;s paradise!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New job</title>
      <link>http://wordbit.com/posts/new-job/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2008 22:17:57 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://wordbit.com/posts/new-job/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&#34;left&#34; src=&#34;http://wordbit.com/images/vtlogo.gif&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve just signed a 6-month contract with &lt;a href=&#34;http://vtechcanada.com&#34;&gt;Vtech&lt;/a&gt; to work as a technical writer in their engineering department! As you probably know, Vtech primarily designs and manufactures cordless phones as well as other wireless devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company usually outsources their documentation to the States. Presently, however, they&amp;rsquo;re developing a completely new product line (sorry, I can&amp;rsquo;t say what it is) and need a writer in-house. This is a new position, so the challenge for me will be in ensuring that I get the information I need from the engineers without taking too much time away from their primary tasks. There are other challenges which I won&amp;rsquo;t get into, suffice to say I&amp;rsquo;ll be involved in some hardcore digital asset management and interface design&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the position works out, I could get a permanent position down the road. Anyway, It&amp;rsquo;s exactly what I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for, so I&amp;rsquo;m excited to start next week!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DocTrain Day 3 - Content choreographers unite</title>
      <link>http://wordbit.com/posts/doctrain-day-3-content-choreographers-unite/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2008 07:26:48 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://wordbit.com/posts/doctrain-day-3-content-choreographers-unite/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/title.png&#34; alt=&#34;title&#34; /&gt; DocTrain chugged along today and picked up some speed with a heavy emphasis on social media. As with yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post, I&amp;rsquo;ll give you the skinny and the slides on each presentation as well my pick for &amp;lsquo;what&amp;rsquo;s hot&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great people, good food, and leading-edge content. Kudos to the organizers and to the Marriott Pinnacle for hosting this terrific event. And a huge thanks also to the Westcoast STC for the opportunity to attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the best of the rest:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Document engineering in user experience design&lt;br /&gt;
**&lt;em&gt;Robert Glushko&lt;/em&gt; (University of California at Berkeley)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With little collaboration between designers (front end) and information architects (back end), the result is a poor user experience. A brilliant mind, Glushko coined a new term today: the content choreographer.&lt;br /&gt;
What&amp;rsquo;s hot: &lt;a href=&#34;http://docordie.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Doc or Die&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/?src=embed&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://static.slideshare.net/swf/logo_embd.png&#34; alt=&#34;SlideShare&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/abelsp/document-engineering-in-user-experience-design&#34;&gt;View&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/upload&#34;&gt;Upload your own&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Social media 101: Now everyone&amp;rsquo;s a technical writer&lt;br /&gt;
**&lt;em&gt;Darren Barefoot&lt;/em&gt; (Capulet Communications)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Youtube to Twitter to Facebook, social media is about two-way conversations, collaboration, sharing, community, transparency, and authenticity. It also means we have to relinquish control of our content.&lt;br /&gt;
What&amp;rsquo;s hot: &lt;a href=&#34;http://commoncraft.com/&#34;&gt;Web 2.0 in plain English&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scribd.com/doc/2886353/Make-Your-Website-Social-Media-Ready&#34;&gt;View slides on scribd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Changing the rules of the game for the benefit of the user&lt;br /&gt;
**&lt;em&gt;Joe Sokohl&lt;/em&gt; (Keane, Inc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his talk, Joe emphasized knowing your end user - especially when training customers. Qualitative research is the key to giving end users what they want, not what you think they want.&lt;br /&gt;
What&amp;rsquo;s hot: &lt;a href=&#34;http://youtube.com/watch?v=xDE8pjiCnSw&#34;&gt;The Kobayashi Maru&lt;/a&gt; approach to solving problems&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/?src=embed&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://static.slideshare.net/swf/logo_embd.png&#34; alt=&#34;SlideShare&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/abelsp/changing-the-rules-of-the-game-for-the-benefit-of-the-user-a-kobayashi-maru-approach-to-developing-usercentered-training-content&#34;&gt;View&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/upload&#34;&gt;Upload your own&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How an author and editor used a wiki to write a book&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Stewart Mader&lt;/em&gt; (Atlassian)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stewart wrote his book using only a wiki. He found that communicating with his editors using a wiki was far more efficient than using email.&lt;br /&gt;
What&amp;rsquo;s hot: &lt;a href=&#34;http://hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom&#34;&gt;WriteRoom&lt;/a&gt; (Mac only&amp;hellip;grrr!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The many-armed starfish: today and tomorrow in social media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Darren Barefoot&lt;/em&gt; (Capulet Communications)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t get enough of Darren - he&amp;rsquo;s a terrific speaker. He expanded on social media tools and explained which ones were most effective for use in marketing strategies.&lt;br /&gt;
What&amp;rsquo;s hot: &lt;a href=&#34;http://brightkite.com/&#34;&gt;Brightkite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**What technical communicators need to know about flash&lt;br /&gt;
**&lt;em&gt;Sarah O&amp;rsquo;Keefe&lt;/em&gt; (Scriptorium Publishing)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flash is finicky, but useful if you need to explain difficult concepts using animation. From motion to shape tweens, we got the basics in this tutorial.&lt;br /&gt;
What&amp;rsquo;s hot: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lumosity.com/&#34;&gt;Brain games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Living multiple lives: The new technical communicator&lt;br /&gt;
**&lt;em&gt;B. Noz Urbina&lt;/em&gt; (Mekon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the closing keynote, Urbina gave practical advice on how to create documents more efficiently and save your company money (the reason companies pay for employees to fly to these conferences in the first place).&lt;br /&gt;
What&amp;rsquo;s hot: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.x-pubs.com/&#34;&gt;Fly me to London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DocTrain Day 2 - XML jockeys flock to the podium</title>
      <link>http://wordbit.com/posts/doctrain-day-2-xml-jockeys-flock-to-the-podium/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2008 06:19:48 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://wordbit.com/posts/doctrain-day-2-xml-jockeys-flock-to-the-podium/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/doctrain.west.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;doctrain.west&#34; /&gt; The conference proper kicked off today with some excellent speakers across the board. There were a lot of presentations, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to keep it short and give you the gist of each one along with my personal &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rsquo;s hot&amp;rdquo; recommendation on something juicy, cool or just plain geeky that I gleaned from the talk. If the slides for the talk are available online, I&amp;rsquo;ll embed them as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So without further ado, here&amp;rsquo;s my take on the presentations that I attended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Bringing the Video Revolution to Technical Communication&lt;br /&gt;
**_RJ Jacquez _(Adobe)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RJ spoke about how we live in a highly visual world where videos are the primary content delivery method - especially for Gen Y.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XML in the Wilderness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Joseph Gollner&lt;/em&gt; (Stilo International)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of XML cannot be underestimated in the design of content technologies. In fact, web 2.0 is a consequence of the &amp;lsquo;openness&amp;rsquo; of XML.&lt;br /&gt;
What&amp;rsquo;s hot: Douglas Engelbart and &lt;a href=&#34;http://youtube.com/watch?v=JfIgzSoTMOs&#34;&gt;the Mother of All Demos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Wikis are wonderful, or are they? A real-world story of using wikis for user information&lt;br /&gt;
**_Alan Porter _(WebWorks)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wiki evangelist Alan Porter showed how his company uses wikis for their intranet as well as for project management with clients.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Neil Perlin&lt;/em&gt; (Hyper/Word Services)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neil reviewed three authoring tools: Captivate, Camtasia, and Mimic. Each tool possesses a different feature set, so it depends what you need them for.&lt;br /&gt;
What&amp;rsquo;s hot: My vote for the most user-friendly tool is Adobe&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.adobe.com/products/captivate/&#34;&gt;Captivate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DocTrain Day 1 - Simplified Technical English</title>
      <link>http://wordbit.com/posts/doctrain-day-1-simplified-technical-english/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2008 03:22:17 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://wordbit.com/posts/doctrain-day-1-simplified-technical-english/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/tp.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;tp&#34; /&gt; Today I attended a pre-conference workshop on Simplified Technical English (STE) at DocTrain West. Berry Braster, director of Tedopres, presented the benefits of writing documentation using standardized, unambiguous English, especially when materials are being translated into other languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implementation of STE involves developing a company-specific dictionary and using documentation software to aid in the mechanical side of ensuring uniformity of language across the board. The goal is to ultimately reduce costs and facilitate quality assurance. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested, here&amp;rsquo;s an abbreviated version of Berry&amp;rsquo;s powerpoint presentation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/?src=embed&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://static.slideshare.net/swf/logo_embd.png&#34; alt=&#34;SlideShare&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/abelsp/simplified-technical-english-how-standardization-of-content-will-reduce-costs-and-facilitate-quality-assurance&#34;&gt;View&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/upload&#34;&gt;Upload your own&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://counters.gigya.com/wildfire/CIMP/bT*xJmx*PTEyMTAxMjk1NDI3NjUmcHQ9MTIxMDEyOTU1NzkzNyZwPTEwMTkxJmQ9Jm49Jmc9Mg==.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt; I found this presentation quite interesting, especially as there is little standardization when it comes to documenting software. Berry actually dismissed Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s style guide, and even the Chicago manual of style, as incompatible with the goals of STE, but did commend them for the attempt. Some of the audience thought that STE could become too stilted and robotic. Personally, however, I could see the merit of choosing vocabulary, for example, that is completely unambiguous when it comes to reducing workplace accidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A case in point - a manual in the aviation industry asked the mechanic to &amp;ldquo;cut the power&amp;rdquo; (ie. turn it off), whereupon a mechanic literally cut a power-line with sheers and died from electrocution.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Find a tech-writing job in Vancouver - Part 3</title>
      <link>http://wordbit.com/posts/find-a-tech-writing-job-in-vancouver-part-3/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2008 17:21:41 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://wordbit.com/posts/find-a-tech-writing-job-in-vancouver-part-3/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/580773.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/580773_thumb.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;580773&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; So, you&amp;rsquo;ve managed to land an interview. Congratulations! Time to prepare by going through possible interview questions and practicing in front of a mirror. Make sure you&amp;rsquo;ve done your research on the company and have some intelligent questions to ask them too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now what do you say once you&amp;rsquo;re sitting in the hot seat? Here are my top five tips for acing that tech-writing job interview:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tell your potential employer that even though you don’t know everything about their widgets right now, you love learning new things. In fact, it’s struggling through the learning process that enables you to communicate with their users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Showcase professional pieces in your portfolio that not only show you’re a wiz in robohelp/framemaker, etc, but also show that you solved a problem and achieved a positive outcome for a real world client. If you don’t have these, volunteer to create them on spec for a non-profit organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t sell yourself short when convincing your employer that writing matters. Make sure your employer knows that strong writing and editing is not just about juggling commas. It’s about organization, understanding your audience, usability, and ultimately creating a satisfying user experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t be afraid to bring in some fresh ideas. Tell your potential employer about audio/visual/interactive elements that you think would enhance their traditional documentation. Show initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relax and be yourself. If you’re a geek who is passionate about technology, grammar, and the latest trends in communication, then it’ll come through in the interview. Remember that you’re trying to find the perfect fit for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In part 4, coming sometime next week, I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about salary negotiations. And if you missed them, be sure to catch up on &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordbit.freehostia.com/find-a-tech-writing-job-in-vancouver-part-1/&#34;&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordbit.freehostia.com/find-a-tech-writing-job-in-vancouver-part-2/&#34;&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt; in this series.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A tech writer theme song</title>
      <link>http://wordbit.com/posts/a-tech-writer-theme-song/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2008 19:37:09 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://wordbit.com/posts/a-tech-writer-theme-song/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every profession needs a theme song, right? Here&amp;rsquo;s one I found about technical writing, unashamedly cannibalized from the &lt;em&gt;Beatles&lt;/em&gt; song &amp;ldquo;Paperback Writer.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[youtube &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMQ2eATq1OI&amp;hl;=en&#34;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMQ2eATq1OI&amp;hl;=en&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This little ditty isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly inspiring with lyrics like these: &amp;ldquo;So I spend my day inside a lonely pod, but I need a job, so I gotta be a technical writer.&amp;rdquo; But hey, it&amp;rsquo;s worth a laugh anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Find a tech-writing job in Vancouver - Part 2</title>
      <link>http://wordbit.com/posts/find-a-tech-writing-job-in-vancouver-part-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2008 19:42:12 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://wordbit.com/posts/find-a-tech-writing-job-in-vancouver-part-2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://wordbit.freehostia.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/chickenhonest.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;chickenhonest&#34; /&gt; I mentioned in part one of this series that 80% of jobs can only be found in that elusive place called &amp;ldquo;the hidden job market.&amp;rdquo; About 20% of those gigs can be gotten through employment services, cold calling, and other tactics, such as information interviews. But the other 60% are landed through referrals. That makes networking your only way to access a big chunk of the job market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do you rustle up some contacts in Vancouver, a city that has a reputation for being a tad on the chilly side?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, a great way to get started is to join the local &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stcwestcoast.ca/&#34;&gt;West coast STC&lt;/a&gt; chapter. Volunteering for them is a great way to make some contacts, probably even more so that just showing up for meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sign up for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bctechnology.com/&#34;&gt;T-Net direct&lt;/a&gt;, a weekly newsletter that tells you what BC technology events are happening around town. Go to events outside of your field, where you don&amp;rsquo;t expect to see a lot of other writers. That way you&amp;rsquo;ll be more unique and make more valuable connections than you would hanging out with other writers who are looking for work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let everyone know you&amp;rsquo;re looking for work, and if your cousin&amp;rsquo;s roommate&amp;rsquo;s girlfriend tells you her brother is a technical writer, ask for his contact info and set up an informational interview. Having some connection, no matter how distant, is always better than interviewing a complete stranger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, don&amp;rsquo;t network to find work. Network to be social and meet people. If you approach everybody as a possible job lead, they&amp;rsquo;ll smell the sleaze on you a mile away. Stay loose and have fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do you ace the tech-writing interview? That&amp;rsquo;ll be in part 3, coming this Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;rsquo;d like to thank the organizer Scott Abel and the good people at the STC for giving me this terrific opportunity. As I mentioned before, if you can afford the $899, or have a generous employer, then be there or don&amp;rsquo;t-be-square.&lt;/p&gt;

This conference kicked off in Vancouver today and is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; place to be if you&amp;rsquo;re facing content management issues in your professional life as a technical writer, or if you want to stay on the leading edge of developments in the field. Each day has a specific theme. Day 1 (today) is about content, day 2 about technology, and day 3 about user relationships. I&amp;rsquo;ll be volunteering there the whole day tomorrow, and will tell you all about it later (if you&amp;rsquo;re going, be sure to say hello).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highlights? The future of XML publishing, the new Quark dynamic publishing demos, social media, mobile content management , and of course, the fabulous food.&lt;/p&gt;
