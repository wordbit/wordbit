      <description>Get your science and techie news served up with a healthy dose of Brit witticisms. Check out The Register, a highly readable site out of the UK that dishes the sarcasm along with the geek factor.
Also, alive - in conjunction with The Good Life Network has just launched their podcast page. You can here my boss Terry-Lynn being interviewed by the silver-tongued Jesse Dylan at aliveonair.com.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m administering a new podcast for Rev. Craig Vance at my church. Craig&amp;rsquo;s sermons are really insightful and quite intellectual. Anyway, the technical side of things has hardly been cutting edge as I&amp;rsquo;ve been recording onto cassette tapes that get chewed up in my 1990 cassette player before they even get turned into an MP3. Nevertheless, I&amp;rsquo;ve managed two so far and plan to keep that site updated every week. Check it out if you&amp;rsquo;re interested.</description>
