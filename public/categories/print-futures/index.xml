      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been about four months since my classmates and I graduated from the Print Futures Professional Writing Program. If you&amp;rsquo;re serious about your craft and are thinking of attending this two-year diploma program, I heartily encourage you to go for it. I love to write and I love getting paid to do it even more. But don&amp;rsquo;t kid yourself - writing well works up a mental sweat for every writer, whether oozing with talent or not.</description>
