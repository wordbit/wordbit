    <p>The choice came down to four phones: the <a href="/posts/2015-flagship-1-htc-one-m9/">HTC One M9</a>, the <a href="/posts/2015-flagship-2-samsung-galaxy-s6/">Samsung Galaxy S6</a>, the <a href="/posts/1271/">LG G4</a>, or the <a href="/posts/2015-flagship-4-iphone-6s/">iPhone 6s</a>. In actuality, a more stark dichotomy lay between Android and Apple, so the choice really came down to two very different approaches.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been living with both Android and iOS, so appreciate the merits of both operating systems. For me, hardware was a bigger consideration, as well as ongoing software support. I also didn&rsquo;t want a gigantic slab of a phone that seems to be the norm these days. So, in the end, I decided to go with the iPhone.</p>

    <p>I blog about work very sparely, and I think most people would agree that saying too much can lead into dangerous territory. So, I tend to avoid it unless I have something general to say that doesn&rsquo;t touch on any work projects. But I would be remiss in my blogging duties not to mention that I have a new job.</p>

<p>I started working as a technical writer at Vtech seven years ago - here&rsquo;s <a href="/posts/new-job/">a post</a> I wrote when I first got the job, and <a href="/posts/what-i-do/">another</a> I wrote about a month in.</p>

      <h5 class="meta">Tue, Oct 27, 2015</h5>
    </header>

    <p>Seeing as I don’t make any money off this blog, I try to keep costs down to a minimum. And so, for the past eight years or so, I’ve had no problems using a free web host to manage my self-hosted Wordpress installation. Until now.</p>

<p>I’ve been pretty busy these days (for reasons which I’ll explain in a later post). But, wanting to post at least once a month, I navigated over to wordbit.com only to discover an ugly 403 error page instead of my home page.</p>

<p>As I alluded to in my last post, the very definition of a &ldquo;flagship&rdquo; has perceptively shifted this past year.</p>

<p>Firstly, mid-range devices with high-end specs and razor-thin profit margins have exploded out of China.</p>

<p>Secondly, the definition of a flagship has skewed heavily toward <em>big</em> phones (formerly known as phablets, but now the norm). Bigger phones tend to get better battery life and are able to fit in better camera components, such as Optical Image Stabilization (OIS).</p>

    </header>

    <p>It&rsquo;s been a long, dry summer - and I&rsquo;m not just talking about the weather. My series on flagship phones has been somewhat stymied by some recent changes in the industry. I was expecting some more flagships to emerge from big boys like Sony and Motorola, but instead there has been a surge of mid-range devices.</p>

<p>After finding all their money was being made on the entry-level Moto G, Motorola decided to scale back on an ambitious successor to last year&rsquo;s Moto X.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been excited to try out Lollipop for a long time, especially after delving deep into Google&rsquo;s new design language, dubbed Material Design, and even using it in my own user interface design projects. But that is precisely the problem with Android, unless you&rsquo;re using a Nexus, you have to wait a long, long time before getting the latest. All told, it takes roughly one year for most Android users to catch up. So, when &ldquo;Android M&rdquo; was announced, I knew my time was near. Except, it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>

    <p>There&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/05/21/408234543/will-your-job-be-done-by-a-machine">this website</a> that will tell you what the odds are of your job being automated in the future. The data for the estimate is derived from an academic paper where the researchers, I&rsquo;m sure, are smug in the knowledge that robots will never replace university professors. Technical writers, however, will apparently not fare so well:</p>

<p><img src="/images/techwriters.jpg" alt="techwriters" /></p>

<p>But then again, most technical writers seem to be the self-deprecating sort who suspect that their profession is perpetually sliding from obscurity into obsolescence anyway.</p>

      <h5 class="meta">Tue, Jun 9, 2015</h5>
    </header>

    <p>Yesterday, WWDC 2015 (Apple&rsquo;s developer conference) showcased what&rsquo;s new in OS X, iOS, and watchOS. There was also an unsurprising &ldquo;one more thing&rdquo; with the introduction of Apple Music. Unlike the massive redesign from<a href="/posts/its-a-sunny-day-in-cupertino/"> last year</a>, it was a pretty low-key affair, with Apple focusing on tweaking and stabilizing its evolving platforms. If there was one theme that emerged from the keynote, however, it would be this: Apple is no software company.</p>

    <p>At Google I/O last week, developments in Android M (Milkshake? Macaroon?), Android Pay, Android Wear, Internet of Things, and VR all made an appearance.</p>

<p>However, it was Google&rsquo;s advancements in machine learning that were the most impressive. The awkwardly-named &ldquo;Now on Tap&rdquo; in Android M exemplified these improvements nicely. Basically, Google will now offer in-context information within apps, emails, or web pages when pressing and holding the home button on your phone.</p>

    <p>Humour has long been a staple of the Internet - in fact, you probably have some favourite delicious sites, such as the Onion or the Oatmeal, that you regularly check on for a fresh serving of laughs. But then there are those single-serving static sites that have been hosting the same joke for years and years and seem impervious to non-renewal. I wonder who keeps paying for these internet one-liners? They had their day in the sun years ago, but now languish in relative obscurity as faded internet legend.</p>
