      <h2><a href='http://wordbit.com/posts/tesla-model-three/'> Tesla&#39;s Model 3</a> </h2>
      <h5 class="meta">Fri, Apr 8, 2016</h5>
    </header>

    <p>Tesla’s <a href="https://www.teslamotors.com/model3">Model 3</a> is not only a jaw-droppingly stylish car, it is also a compelling window into a future world where the electric car is king.</p>

<p>It certainly has anyone who is interested in technology and design drooling. Tesla’s electric cars come across as gadgets, complete with over-the-air software upgrades - not boring utilitarian vehicles.</p>

<p>Indeed, the Model 3 truly is a product of the tech industry. It’s also an eccentric genius billionaire’s baby. Which makes Tesla a truly unique company, and the Model 3 an astoundingly fresh entrant in a stale car industry. An industry, by the way, that last saw true innovation over a hundred years ago with the debut of Henry Ford’s Model T.</p>

<p>But is the Model 3 really a vision of the future, or merely a mirage?</p>

      <h5 class="meta">Fri, Mar 25, 2016</h5>

    <p>There’s a poignant moment in <em>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</em> when the Holy Grail crosses the Great Seal and triggers the collapse of the Temple of the Sun. The earth is torn asunder, and Elsa, a Nazi agent and Austrian archaeologist, loses her life. After Indiana Jones fails to save her, he ends up hanging precariously in the crevice himself.</p>

<p>Indiana’s father catches his hand and tries to pull him to safety. But, with his other hand, Indiana tries to reach the Holy Grail, which rests tantalizingly on a narrow ledge nearby. He can almost reach it; his fingertips brush it. But his father cannot hold on as oily sweat causes their hands to slip.</p>

<p>Indiana’s father (so aptly played by Sean Connery), says, in a soft, gentle voice: “Indiana… Indiana… let it go”.</p>

<p>And he does. As Indiana rides into the sunset and John William’s theme song swells over the closing credits, we knew it really was his last crusade.</p>

<p>But we were wrong.</p>

    <p>Kanye West&rsquo;s new album is fantastic. At least, that&rsquo;s what people who&rsquo;ve signed up for Tidal say. Because Jay Z’s streaming service is the only place you can get it.</p>

<p>Except for, of course, other illicit means. But we’ll get to that later.</p>

<p>So, after the album’s release, Kanye crowed on Twitter that his album will never be available on Apple Music (or on CDs for that matter).</p>

<p>It feels like the West Coast vs East Coast rivalry all over again. We have Apple Music on the West Coast, with Dr. Dre and friends. Then we have Jay Z and crew representing the East Coast.</p>

<p>Or, should I say, the metaphorical East Coast. Because it’s not like Jay Z or Kanye actually live in the godforsaken east. They live in California of course, along with everybody else famous.</p>

<p>But clearly, Kanye does not want to attend any more parties in L.A. So, what gives?</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;m sure you are familiar with the “nature vs nurture” debate. If not, google it - I’ll wait.</p>

<p>Got it? Good. For me, most explanations for human behaviour can be lumped into the “nurture” side - a bias, no doubt, fostered by my time studying anthropology at university.</p>

<p>However, there is something to be said for the “nature” side as well. Evolution bakes instinctual responses into the DNA of all animals, after all. Horses, for example, have an innate fear of snakes, and therefore snake-like objects. Sometimes, a horse will rear when faced with a snake-shaped stick.</p>

      <h5 class="meta">Sat, Jan 16, 2016</h5>
    </header>

    <p>It’s January and most people like to write about New Year resolutions, or predictions for the year ahead. But I’m quite tired. And no, I didn’t mean that to sound like a sardonic riff of a <em>Flight of the Conchords</em> song. I just feel like writing something more free flowing and fun that requires less research, intense pondering or tortured introspection.</p>

<p>So, I’m going to compile a breezy list of things I’m looking forward to in 2016. Just off the top of my head. And in no particular order. Yes, the year ahead will bring weddings and babies (not mine, just to be clear), which is all very exciting of course. And I have a new job to sink my teeth into, which is very satisfying. I also want to be… better in 2016, in many ways. But forget about that for now. Let’s talk about music, tech, movies, games, books, and that sort of superficial, but fun, fluffy stuff.</p>

      <h2><a href='http://wordbit.com/posts/Norway/'> Norway</a> </h2>
      <h5 class="meta">Sat, Dec 12, 2015</h5>
    </header>

    <p>Well, since I have a five-hour layover here in Amsterdam, I may as well rustle together some thoughts on my trip to Norway.</p>

<p>The only reason for my visit was for work, so let me start with my time at Kongsberg Maritime. After an unsuccessful attempt at using DITA at VTech, I was a little skeptical about plunging into structured authoring, although I was willing to learn the tools of course.</p>

<p>But Ragnar, the senior information developer over there, put me through a DITA boot camp where he promised I would eat, sleep, and dream of XML and DITA. And I did. So, did I emerge a DITA disciple, ready to spread the word at home?</p>

      <h2><a href='http://wordbit.com/posts/2015-flagship-winner/'> 2015 Flagship winner</a> </h2>
      <h5 class="meta">Thu, Nov 19, 2015</h5>
    </header>

    <p>The choice came down to four phones: the <a href="/posts/2015-flagship-1-htc-one-m9/">HTC One M9</a>, the <a href="/posts/2015-flagship-2-samsung-galaxy-s6/">Samsung Galaxy S6</a>, the <a href="/posts/1271/">LG G4</a>, or the <a href="/posts/2015-flagship-4-iphone-6s/">iPhone 6s</a>. In actuality, a more stark dichotomy lay between Android and Apple, so the choice really came down to two very different approaches.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been living with both Android and iOS, so appreciate the merits of both operating systems. For me, hardware was a bigger consideration, as well as ongoing software support. I also didn&rsquo;t want a gigantic slab of a phone that seems to be the norm these days. So, in the end, I decided to go with the iPhone.</p>

    </header>

    <p>I blog about work very sparely, and I think most people would agree that saying too much can lead into dangerous territory. So, I tend to avoid it unless I have something general to say that doesn&rsquo;t touch on any work projects. But I would be remiss in my blogging duties not to mention that I have a new job.</p>

<p>I started working as a technical writer at Vtech seven years ago - here&rsquo;s <a href="/posts/new-job/">a post</a> I wrote when I first got the job, and <a href="/posts/what-i-do/">another</a> I wrote about a month in.</p>

      <h5 class="meta">Tue, Oct 27, 2015</h5>
    </header>

    <p>Seeing as I don’t make any money off this blog, I try to keep costs down to a minimum. And so, for the past eight years or so, I’ve had no problems using a free web host to manage my self-hosted Wordpress installation. Until now.</p>

<p>I’ve been pretty busy these days (for reasons which I’ll explain in a later post). But, wanting to post at least once a month, I navigated over to wordbit.com only to discover an ugly 403 error page instead of my home page.</p>

    </header>

    <p><img src="/images/iphone6s.jpg" alt="iphone6s" /></p>

<p>As I alluded to in my last post, the very definition of a &ldquo;flagship&rdquo; has perceptively shifted this past year.</p>

<p>Firstly, mid-range devices with high-end specs and razor-thin profit margins have exploded out of China.</p>

<p>Secondly, the definition of a flagship has skewed heavily toward <em>big</em> phones (formerly known as phablets, but now the norm). Bigger phones tend to get better battery life and are able to fit in better camera components, such as Optical Image Stabilization (OIS).</p>
