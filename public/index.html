      <h2><a href='http://wordbit.com/posts/banned-for-blogging-about-apple/'> Banned for blogging about Apple</a> </h2>
      <h5 class="meta">Tue, Oct 27, 2015</h5>
    </header>

    Seeing as I don’t make any money off this blog, I try to keep costs down to a minimum. And so, for the past eight years or so, I’ve had no problems using a free web host to manage my self-hosted Wordpress installation. Until now. I’ve been pretty busy these days (for reasons which I’ll explain in a later post). But, wanting to post at least once a month, I navigated over to wordbit.com only to discover an ugly 403 error page instead of my home page.

      <h5 class="meta">Fri, Sep 25, 2015</h5>
    </header>

    As I alluded to in my last post, the very definition of a &ldquo;flagship&rdquo; has perceptively shifted this past year. Firstly, mid-range devices with high-end specs and razor-thin profit margins have exploded out of China. Secondly, the definition of a flagship has skewed heavily toward big phones (formerly known as phablets, but now the norm). Bigger phones tend to get better battery life and are able to fit in better camera components, such as Optical Image Stabilization (OIS).

      <h5 class="meta">Wed, Aug 26, 2015</h5>
    </header>

    It&rsquo;s been a long, dry summer - and I&rsquo;m not just talking about the weather. My series on flagship phones has been somewhat stymied by some recent changes in the industry. I was expecting some more flagships to emerge from big boys like Sony and Motorola, but instead there has been a surge of mid-range devices. After finding all their money was being made on the entry-level Moto G, Motorola decided to scale back on an ambitious successor to last year&rsquo;s Moto X.

    </header>

    I&rsquo;ve been excited to try out Lollipop for a long time, especially after delving deep into Google&rsquo;s new design language, dubbed Material Design, and even using it in my own user interface design projects. But that is precisely the problem with Android, unless you&rsquo;re using a Nexus, you have to wait a long, long time before getting the latest. All told, it takes roughly one year for most Android users to catch up.

    There&rsquo;s this website that will tell you what the odds are of your job being automated in the future. The data for the estimate is derived from an academic paper where the researchers, I&rsquo;m sure, are smug in the knowledge that robots will never replace university professors. Technical writers, however, will apparently not fare so well: But then again, most technical writers seem to be the self-deprecating sort who suspect that their profession is perpetually sliding from obscurity into obsolescence anyway.

    Yesterday, WWDC 2015 (Apple&rsquo;s developer conference) showcased what&rsquo;s new in OS X, iOS, and watchOS. There was also an unsurprising &ldquo;one more thing&rdquo; with the introduction of Apple Music. Unlike the massive redesign from last year, it was a pretty low-key affair, with Apple focusing on tweaking and stabilizing its evolving platforms. If there was one theme that emerged from the keynote, however, it would be this: Apple is no software company.

    At Google I/O last week, developments in Android M (Milkshake? Macaroon?), Android Pay, Android Wear, Internet of Things, and VR all made an appearance. However, it was Google&rsquo;s advancements in machine learning that were the most impressive. The awkwardly-named &ldquo;Now on Tap&rdquo; in Android M exemplified these improvements nicely. Basically, Google will now offer in-context information within apps, emails, or web pages when pressing and holding the home button on your phone.

    Humour has long been a staple of the Internet - in fact, you probably have some favourite delicious sites, such as the Onion or the Oatmeal, that you regularly check on for a fresh serving of laughs. But then there are those single-serving static sites that have been hosting the same joke for years and years and seem impervious to non-renewal. I wonder who keeps paying for these internet one-liners? They had their day in the sun years ago, but now languish in relative obscurity as faded internet legend.

      <h2><a href='http://wordbit.com/posts/1271/'> 2015 Flagship 3: LG G4</a> </h2>
      <h5 class="meta">Tue, May 12, 2015</h5>
    </header>

    When it comes to the blossoming South Korean GDP, whether Samsung or LG triumphs is a moot point. But nonetheless, there is a cute national rivalry between these two Korean companies in their efforts to one-up each other. And it has served them well. When looking at 2014 sales, Samsung is currently the top smartphone manufacturer in the world, and LG is in a respectable fifth place. If Samsung is the aggressive older brother, then LG comes off as the clean-cut, conservative younger brother who is extremely capable, but somewhat boring.

    Tens of thousands of years ago, humans would gather around the fire at night and share stories. We craved narratives to explain our world. And in the crackling fires of the darkest nights, myth and legend was born. As the oral tradition was displaced by the written word, our appetite for storytelling only increased. For thousands of years, from the Bible to Shakespeare - we&rsquo;ve clung especially tight to those narratives that define the very essence of humanity, through courage, conflict, betrayal, and love.
