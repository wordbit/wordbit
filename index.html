      <h2><a href='https://wordbit.com/posts/the-horse-i-rode-in-on/'> The horse I rode in on</a> </h2>
      <h5 class="meta">Mon, Aug 29, 2022</h5>
    </header>

    <p>Her name was Bailey - and she was the best horse. Gentle, plodding, and content to stay in line - instead of bolt ahead like Dexter (the horse behind me bearing her unfortunate rider). Bailey&rsquo;s calm temperament, despite carrying a new rider, was most welcome.</p>

<p>It was an especially hot day in the Cariboo. An unusually wet spring, however, had kept the landscape verdant and the mosquitoes thriving. Due to the heat, our route led us through serene, shaded forest rather than open plains.</p>

<p>I felt a good connection with Bailey - a slight tug at the reigns was sufficient to nudge her in the right direction. And when we dismounted for a rest stop, she responded to my call when the time came to mount up once more.</p>

<p>Given my lack of experience (does riding a horse in <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> count?), trotting was uncomfortable at first, until I started to anticipate Bailey&rsquo;s rhythm and stand up in the saddle. The last time I had ridden a horse (in real life) was 18 years ago in Costa Rica, so it had been awhile.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s something so meditative and calming about swaying in the saddle, listening to the monotonous clip-clop of the hooves, and simply trusting this magnificent animal to bear your weight on a day when it&rsquo;s too hot to even walk.</p>

      <h2><a href='https://wordbit.com/posts/back-to-the-backcountry/'> Back to the backcountry</a> </h2>
      <h5 class="meta">Thu, Jul 21, 2022</h5>
    </header>

    <p>Summer is in full swing, which means desk jockeys who spend all day in front of the computer are forced to venture outside and get sunburns, mosquito bites, and decreased life expectancy from breathing in campfire smoke. Unless sitting all day (which is, of course, &ldquo;the new smoking&rdquo;) hasn&rsquo;t exacted an even worse toll.</p>

<p>Seriously though, I do love being outdoors, soaking up the beauty of nature in person instead of settling for Planet Earth in HDR. I also appreciate being in areas with no cell service. I hate to use the phrase &ldquo;tech detox&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;s a great tech detox. Taking an extended break from being online only makes you appreciate the internet more when you return.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m well aware that there is an anti-tech movement out there with zealots who switch their smartphones for flip phones , only use paper books and maps, and eschew screens of any kind. But I don&rsquo;t think we can go backwards. It only takes the frustrating and lengthy act of texting on a flip phone for the doubt to creep in.</p>

<p>Smartphones are actually more efficient because they save time. It&rsquo;s quicker to follow GPS directions than stare helplessly at a paper map. E-books save so much space that even Marie Kondo can&rsquo;t deny the benefits. I could go on.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I&rsquo;m genuinely mystified on how people can spend four to five hours on their phones everyday. Is there really that much to do after reading a few tweets?</p>

<p>Regardless, some time in the backcountry, away from civilization - and far away from the crowds - is good for everybody.</p>

      <h5 class="meta">Thu, Jun 30, 2022</h5>
    </header>

    <p>What more could you ask for from Apple&rsquo;s WWDC than a plethora of Craig Federighi (aka Hair Force One) memes? From Craig&rsquo;s hair blowing in the wind to Craig in a garish tracksuit - we got it all.</p>

<p>Apple&rsquo;s video production team proves once again that online video presentations are more fun for Apple fans who could never afford to attend in person.</p>

<p>Although Apple did invite a group of both developers and journalists to attend, it was only to watch the video presentation outside while getting painfully toasted in the Californian sun. Not really worth the expense, in my opinion, even if you got to eat croissants in the Apple Park café.</p>

<p>Who knows what next year will bring. But, for now, I&rsquo;m enjoying the cheeky transitions and faster pace of a pre-recorded show.</p>

<p>As is tradition around here, here are my personal thoughts and impressions of what went down. For a full detailed rundown, head over to your favourite tech journalism site&hellip;</p>

      <h2><a href='https://wordbit.com/posts/a-lot-cooking-but-not-much-to-eat/'> Google I/O - a lot cooking, but not much to eat</a> </h2>
      <h5 class="meta">Fri, May 27, 2022</h5>
    </header>

    <p>At Google I/O ten years ago Sergey Brin dropped into a Google Hangout with a gang of daredevil skydivers wearing Google Glass. The demo was messy, chaotic and infused with pure hubris.</p>

<p>Both Google Hangouts and Glass are now discontinued. But the 2012 Google I/O is still the most memorable one, if only for its overreaching ambition.</p>

<p>This year&rsquo;s I/O felt very similar to ones from the last few years - measured, academic, and forgetful. It was only at the end when a glimmer of excitement made me sit up straighter in my chair.</p>

<p>Google Glass had returned.</p>

<p>Well&hellip; not exactly. The ever-respectable and approachable Sundar Pichai, waxing on about the possibilities of AR, <a href="https://youtu.be/lj0bFX9HXeE">dropped a video</a> showing a prototype of smart glasses stripped of everything - including the &ldquo;glasshole&rdquo; camera  - that only performed one function: real-time language translation.</p>

<p>Google is onto something here. Single-purpose gadgets can become great products precisely because they are born out of constraint to become focused tools. It&rsquo;s the natural evolution of product design that precedes the all-purpose &ldquo;one device&rdquo;. You simply cannot converge into a compelling device that &ldquo;does everything&rdquo; before the technology is ready.</p>

<p>I only hope that Google stays the course with this - not unlike many other dreamers I know, they&rsquo;re just really bad at finishing what they started. One thing&rsquo;s for sure though - nobody is going to be calling an Asian grandmother struggling to understand English a &ldquo;glasshole&rdquo;. Google&rsquo;s scaled-back approach is definitely devoid of any hubris this time.</p>

      <h2><a href='https://wordbit.com/posts/what-happened-to-julie/'> What happened to Julie?</a> </h2>
      <h5 class="meta">Thu, Apr 28, 2022</h5>
    </header>

    <p>I was starting to wonder if I&rsquo;m the only human on planet Earth who still writes blog posts anymore. I&rsquo;m not going to lie - now that social media is entrenched into the fabric of the 21st century, blog posts seem retro and anachronistic - even to an old man like me.</p>

<p>And then I came across Matt Gemmell&rsquo;s <a href="https://mattgemmell.com/content-creation/">brilliant insight</a> on the rhetoric of writing in these dark times, giving much-needed context to my thoughts. He&rsquo;s right - words matter. Gemmell sees &ldquo;a worrying trend towards trivialisation amongst those who make things on their own&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I found his disassembly of the phrase &ldquo;blog post&rdquo; particularly insightful.</p>

<p>He points out that the word &ldquo;blog&rdquo; has &ldquo;connotations of the ramblings of some random person, without authority or polish&rdquo;.</p>

<p>And here is his take on the word &ldquo;post&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It focuses on the mechanic of putting-up, making the actual published material almost irrelevant. It’s an emission; it’s another chunk. That’s minimising, and trivialising. It’s insulting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gemmell brings it home by calling out &ldquo;content&rdquo; as the most hideous word out there: &ldquo;content is fungible, space-filling, placeholder-replacing <em>stuff</em>, and that’s not even its most offensive connotation,&rdquo; he argues.</p>

<p>Read the rest of his piece to see how the offense escalates.</p>

<p>So, perhaps I won&rsquo;t call my longform pieces &ldquo;blog posts&rdquo; anymore. To counterbalance the insidious narrative, writers need to re-frame what we do. If blogging is dead, then it is us who should wield the knife.</p>

<p>And needless to say, I&rsquo;ll be calling myself a &ldquo;writer&rdquo; until the day I die - never a &ldquo;content creator&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s no wonder that such a demeaning job title asks for so little pay. It really is depressing how far the monetary value of the written word has plummeted. And how so many writers are complicit because they have been beaten into submission and have lost all confidence in their craft and talents.</p>

      <h5 class="meta">Thu, Mar 24, 2022</h5>
    </header>

    <p>Thank you, Apple, for giving me something to write about besides from today&rsquo;s unholy trinity of war, disease, and inflation.</p>

<p>Perhaps not as flashy as last year&rsquo;s <a href="/posts/spring-loaded/">Spring Loaded</a> digital event, <a href="https://youtu.be/CUwg_JoNHpo">Peek Performance</a> was nonetheless a nice, mellow start to the 2022 Apple news cycle. And was also another opportunity for Apple&rsquo;s chip team to flex hard.</p>

<p>This presentation was a no-nonsense, all-business affair. Given the complete lack of levity, especially from a dead-eyed Tim Cook, you get the feeling Apple is ready to move on from pre-recorded video and return to in-person events.</p>

<p>I have to give Apple inclusivity credit though - most of the presenters were women this time and they were all lively and engaging.</p>

<p>So, I&rsquo;m going to continue a tradition here and give my &ldquo;thumbs up&rdquo; and &ldquo;thumbs down&rdquo; impressions of each announcement as I did in last year&rsquo;s Spring event.</p>

<p>Here we go.</p>

      <h2><a href='https://wordbit.com/posts/the-february-doldrums/'> The February doldrums &#43; some advice</a> </h2>
      <h5 class="meta">Mon, Feb 28, 2022</h5>
    </header>

    <p>There&rsquo;s normally nothing tech-related to write about in February - this month is no exception. And this February in particular, there really is nothing fun to write about.</p>

<p>I could get into all sorts of controversial topics, but that&rsquo;s not what we do here. If you&rsquo;re a future historian combing old web archives, just look February 2022 up and you&rsquo;ll have more than enough to write ten research papers. You&rsquo;ve got everything from trucker protests to Russia invading Ukraine.</p>

<p>On a personal note, I was out of commission for a while earlier this month with COVID. Getting &ldquo;the rona&rdquo; was an inevitable development, but I made it through more-or-less intact, which is about the best outcome one could hope for. And the latest Omicron variant turned out to be more like a bad flu than the more aggressive variants that came before.</p>

<p>So, anyway, I promised some advice before I sign off.</p>

    <p>Most people love colour.</p>

<p>We personalize our clothes, decorate our homes, and choose our foods based on colour. Right from the start of life, every kid has a favourite colour. Colour even affects our moods.</p>

<p>In nature, colour serves a biological purpose - whether it serves as camouflage, a warning (don&rsquo;t eat me!), or as an advertisement to the opposite sex.</p>

<p>In art, we try to mimic nature. Pigments mixed to the precise hue and saturation of a myriad of colours bring a painting to startling life.</p>

<p>In technology, we try to mimic art. Only bright displays with a wide colour gamut are likely to dazzle shoppers strolling through the TV gallery at Best Buy.</p>

<p>At its essence, colour is light. Or more precisely, colours are light waves reflected off an object into the optic nerves of our eyes.</p>

<p>The opposite of light is, of course, darkness. A lot of people are scared of the dark. There is also a biological reason for this: The most dangerous predators are nocturnal (it&rsquo;s hard to erase a few millions years of evolution). Complete darkness, as you would find deep in a cave underground, is truly black.</p>

<p>Black is the absence of colour. It is not celebrated. Only weird Goths or funeral attendees dress all in black; only serial killers and Marilyn Manson paint their walls black. It&rsquo;s safe to say that black gets a bad rap (except when I was ten years old and everybody switched their favourite colour to black because of KITT from Knight Rider).</p>

<p>But as a counterpoint to colour, black is essential.</p>

      <h2><a href='https://wordbit.com/posts/so-this-is-christmas/'> So this is Christmas</a> </h2>
      <h5 class="meta">Thu, Dec 23, 2021</h5>
    </header>

    <p>Before you continue reading, I should warn you that this post is a bit of a bummer. So, if you&rsquo;re hoping to get into the Christmas spirit, click away and have a laugh at TikTok or whatever the kids do these days.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll try end on a positive note, although I haven&rsquo;t gotten there yet obviously as I&rsquo;ve just started writing and I don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;m going with this yet. Everywhere and nowhere, most likely, is where all flows of consciousness tend to go.</p>

<p>So, if you&rsquo;re a jaded middle-aged adult like me, you&rsquo;ve probably come to the realization that Christmas is about shielding the horrid state of the world from your kids. It&rsquo;s about furtive doom scrolling bathed in the glow of the Christmas tree. It&rsquo;s maintaining a fantasy, crafting myth and mystery, an antidote against the literal darkest month of the year, knowing all the while it is simply a placebo.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s exhausting. And we&rsquo;re the lucky ones. For those in the cold, without family, food, or a place to sleep, it&rsquo;s absolutely the worst time of year. The best of times and the worst of times - the border between these two extremes has become very porous this year.</p>

      <h2><a href='https://wordbit.com/posts/the-seven-year-itch/'> The seven-year itch</a> </h2>
      <h5 class="meta">Fri, Nov 12, 2021</h5>
    </header>

    <p>I was pretty excited when <a href="/posts/how-are-you-still-alive/">I found out</a> my iPhone 6S would get an incredible of seven years of software support (up to at least the end of 2022). In fact, if you&rsquo;re a regular reader of this blog, you&rsquo;re probably sick of me crowing about how my 6S marches on when Android equivalents lie long dead in the grave.</p>

<p>Which is why I feel terrible about this.</p>

<p>6S, I&rsquo;m ditching you.</p>

<p>Actually, I don&rsquo;t feel that terrible. I guess I could stick it out it until the bitter end, but the truth is that the end-of-life stage is never pretty. The performance of my 6S is really choking, especially when it comes to the shutter speed on the camera. It&rsquo;s a familiar sign of old age - when it takes a few seconds to snap one picture, you know the end is near.</p>

<p>The battery life is even worse, as to be expected on the second-thinnest iPhone ever made (the iPhone 6 is the thinnest). I&rsquo;m used to plugging in my 6S every couple of hours, but that&rsquo;s no way to live.</p>

<p>Admittedly, this drop in performance is typical of any new iOS version, which typically gets a lot better after a few iterations - iOS 15 is no exception. But man, I just can&rsquo;t stomach the thought of spending a seventh year with the 6S - life&rsquo;s just too short.</p>

<p>So, having made that decision - what&rsquo;s My Next?</p>
