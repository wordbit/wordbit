        <section id="main">
          <h5 id="date"> Tue Dec 30, 2014 </h5>
          <p>According to Goodreads, I managed to read 14 books in 2014. These are the titles (in order of date read):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Shift (Silo, #2) - Howey, Hugh</p></li>

<li><p>The Waste Lands (The Dark Tower, #3) - King, Stephen</p></li>

<li><p>Dust (Silo, #3) - Howey, Hugh</p></li>

<li><p>Wizard and Glass (The Dark Tower, #4) - King, Stephen</p></li>

<li><p>The Shadow of the Wind (The Cemetery of Forgotten Books, #1) - Zafón, Carlos Ruiz</p></li>

<li><p>Wolves of the Calla (The Dark Tower, #5) - King, Stephen</p></li>

<li><p>Feedback - Cawdron, Peter</p></li>

<li><p>Song of Susannah (The Dark Tower, #6) - King, Stephen</p></li>

<li><p>The Lies of Locke Lamora (Gentleman Bastard, #1) - Lynch, Scott</p></li>

<li><p>The Dark Tower (The Dark Tower, #7) - King, Stephen</p></li>

<li><p>Red Seas Under Red Skies (Gentleman Bastard, #2) - Lynch, Scott</p></li>

<li><p>The Martian - Weir, Andy</p></li>

<li><p>The Republic of Thieves (Gentleman Bastard, #3) - Lynch, Scott</p></li>

<li><p>The Passage (The Passage, #1) - Cronin, Justin</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You may have noticed that I don&rsquo;t like to read a series straight through. I interspersed <em>The Dark Tower</em> series of seven books, for example, with other books in-between each novel. Although it took me a long time to get through it, I never got bored of the characters. I find this a good way to approach a long-running series instead of &ldquo;binge reading&rdquo;.</p>

<p>A standout book this year was <em>The Martian</em>, which was published this year and has already been optioned for a movie next year starring Matt Damon. There&rsquo;s lots to look forward to in the next year or two. The next books in <em>The Gentleman Bastard</em> and <em>The Passage</em> series should be coming out, as well as the next <em>Fire and Ice</em> book, <em>The Winds of Winter</em>. I&rsquo;m also planning on getting into Brandon Sanderson&rsquo;s <em>The Stormlight Archive</em> series, which has gotten enthusiastic reviews from fantasy lovers.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a great feature in the Kindle Paperwhite called &ldquo;Vocabulary Builder&rdquo;. Basically, any word you look up appears in the Builder and you can even review them with flashcards to beef up your vocabulary. I find that words don&rsquo;t stick as well as they used to when I was younger, so any augmentation to my brain is most welcome. Just for laughs, here are some of the words in my personal Vocal Builder:</p>

<hr />

<p><em>suppurate, apiary, hypoxemia, gestalt, pronghorn, crocuses, cuirass, culvert, caparisoned, reliquary, tines, trivet, cloisonne, spironolactone, peons, mendacity, sinecures, xebec, possets, sprat, dreideling, knavish, ingress, regia, hauck, eldritch, spavined, widdershins, diaphanous, petechiae, travois, catafalque, numismatic, acromegaly, opalescent, hauteur, bunting, oshkosh, gabardine, excrescence, akron, hydrocephalus, freshet, tintinnabulation, fistula, usury, nacelle, hinky, interregnum, ague, pedipalps, tourmaline, pomanders, ducal, contrapuntal, megrims, pellucid, huaraches, avgas, quonset</em></p>

<hr />

<p>One more thing - one of the supposed characteristics of the extremely wealthy, the one percent if you will, is that they read far more non-fiction books than fiction books. Well, I think it&rsquo;s safe to say that I&rsquo;m not particularly wealthy (by Western standards - in Ethiopa, I&rsquo;d be doing alright) and probably am not going to be a millionaire anytime soon. But I think it is a terrible mistake to forsake your soul in pursuit of material gain  - and what better way to forsake your soul than to give over the intimate act of reading to scheming and conniving. Franz Kafka once said that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We need books that affect us like a disaster, that grieve us deeply, like the death of someone we loved more than ourselves, like being banished into forests far from everyone, like a suicide. A book must be the axe for the frozen sea within us. That is my belief.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You won&rsquo;t confront your humanity be reading get-rich-quick books. If you cannot agree with me on this then it&rsquo;s already too late for you and you do not have my sympathies.</p>

<p>On a lighter note, let me wish everybody a merry Christmas and a very happy New Year. I hope you all get to indulge in some reading over the holidays. See you next year!</p>
