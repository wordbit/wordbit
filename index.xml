      <title>March (viral) madness</title>
      <link>https://wordbit.com/posts/march-viral-madness/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In January, I said that 2020 was &amp;ldquo;going to be one heck of a year&amp;rdquo;, but…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://wordbit.com/images/tenor.gif&#34; alt=&#34;notlikethis&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, the struggle to contain the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) pandemic has put a strain on all areas of life. As I write this, Canada is in the thick of it - with playgrounds, schools, restaurants, unessential services, conferences, and even international borders closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the worst public health crisis I&amp;rsquo;ve personally ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any gathering of more than 50 people is prohibited. We are all working from home (I&amp;rsquo;ve been out of the office for two solid weeks now) and there is no more toilet paper. We have not, however, been issued a shelter-in-place order (as in California) that prohibits people from going outside. There are plenty of people enjoying the spring sunshine on the beach - and they’re not staying six feet apart. I’m sure our Provincial Health Officer has cocked her eyebrow at these hedonists and has her finger on the stay-at-home trigger..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resulting economic slowdown from all this, while arguably not as serious as the death toll, has nonetheless triggered a terrible domino effect of temporary layoffs, a ravaged stock market, and personal hardship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not the 2020 we were hoping for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am, however, encouraged by the proactive measures we’re taking as a society to curb this deadly flu. Let’s not forget that the first appearance of the H1N1 strain in 1918 killed up to fifty million people. We’re doing a good thing here. The “curve” has already “flattened” in Asia, so I’m optimistic that the societal shutdown over here will be brief, but memorable.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What I got wrong</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last month I took stock at the start of a new decade and had some fun thinking about both the previous and the next ten years in tech. Because it was so much fun, I’d like to continue on from last month’s theme and go a bit deeper on the tech retrospective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked back on some old blog posts from the last decade where I made some sort of prediction to see if I got anything right. I mostly didn’t. Being a soothsayer is, quite frankly, really hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, instead, here are some predictions I got wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Welcome, humans, to 2020</title>
      <link>https://wordbit.com/posts/welcome-to-2020-humans/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The fun part of starting a new decade is looking back at how much has changed since 2010 and also imagining what life will be like a decade from now in 2030. Covering it all would take several pages, so I’ll just focus on one or two things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But firstly, in the spirit of “living in the now” (party on Wayne and Garth), I’d like to express my deep appreciation of living in the year 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are living in the future -  and the future is now. These are remarkable times on cultural, political, and technological fronts - and I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else (chronologically speaking). So here’s to 2020 - it’s going to be one heck of a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago, I was newly married, childless, and just starting out in my Technical Writing career. Now I’m a grizzled father with grey in my beard and metaphorically-calloused hands that rest confidently on the helm of my writing career. I’m not quite a seasoned Information Developer, but I’m getting there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2010, wordbit.com was only three years old and was still the top hit when you googled “wordbit”. Now you’d be lucky to find my site on page two of the search results. A two-bit Android app for learning languages has usurped my brand, but there’s not much I can do about it. My site, however, is still the top hit on DuckDuckGo - so thanks for that you wonderfully obscure privacy-focused search engine that everyone should use but nobody does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2019 brought us more ways to flex</title>
      <link>https://wordbit.com/posts/2019-brought-us-more-ways-to-flex/</link>

      <guid>https://wordbit.com/posts/2019-brought-us-more-ways-to-flex/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s already time for a year-end wrap up. Not that I’ve ever done a year-end wrap up. But I intend to remedy this oversight; it’s clichéd, easy, and fun - so why the hell not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of important, serious topics that dominated the conversation in 2019. But I’m not going to talk about any of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I’m going to talk about foldable phones, fake airpods, and cybertrucks - three uniquely 2019 ways for the important man to cultivate an air of swaggering braggadocio. Ladies and gentleman, this is how you flex in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I’ll wrap up by discussing the best game, book, and movie I played, read, and watched this year. To be clear, my faves may not have hit the shelves in 2019, but they’re new for me - and these top picks get my thumbs up for a high enjoyment factor at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sound good? Let’s get started.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reid City 3 review</title>
      <link>https://wordbit.com/posts/reid-city-3-review/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2019 18:22:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://wordbit.com/posts/reid-city-3-review/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got a new bike! It’s a nice upgrade from my extremely old and now-broken Norco mountain bike. This time around, I looked for a decent hybrid bike and my local bike shop recommended the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reidbikes.com/product/city-3/&#34;&gt;Reid City 3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t want a cheap Canadian Tire or Sportchek bike with a short life and flimsy no-name components, nor did I want to pay a premium for a well-known brand such as Trek or Giant. And although you can definitely save money going for a well-serviced used bike, I opted for new because I tend to keep my stuff for a long time. So, I decided to go with Reid - a promising newcomer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reid is an Australian company and they’ve only recently introduced their bikes to Canada. They’re decently priced ($570 CAD retail, but it’s the end of the season, so I got 20 percent off that). But the most important thing is that they have a lifetime warranty on the frame, so they’re not messing around. The City 3 comes with decent Shimano, Suntour, and Tektro components as well as Kenda tires. And if I wanted to, upgrading the components wouldn’t be a problem with the hydroformed aluminum frame serving as a solid base to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The City 3 can be classified as a dual-sport hybrid because it has a slightly thicker tire and a suspension fork, which traditional hybrids don’t have. It’s great for constantly switching between gravel trails and paved roads, which is pretty much all we have around here in the Vancouver suburbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When compared to other dual-sport hybrids on the market, the City 3 holds up really well on paper. To get a specific idea of what that means, let’s do a spec comparison between the City 3 and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.trekbikes.com/ca/en_CA/bikes/hybrid-bikes/dual-sport-bikes/dual-sport/dual-sport-1/p/23066/#&#34;&gt;Trek Dual Sport 1&lt;/a&gt;, another entry-level hybrid on the market from a more well-known brand.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>And so the leaves fall</title>
      <link>https://wordbit.com/posts/and-so-the-leaves-fall/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2019 22:17:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://wordbit.com/posts/and-so-the-leaves-fall/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before we get into it, let’s take a moment to acknowledge that America’s nukes will &lt;a href=&#34;https://thenextweb.com/us/2019/10/18/us-military-nuclear-floppy-disks/&#34;&gt;no longer run on giant floppy disks&lt;/a&gt;. Should we feel safer, now that a nuclear apocalypse no longer depends on a computer introduced in 1976? Not necessarily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The military needs to rewatch &lt;em&gt;Battlestar Galactica&lt;/em&gt;. The major benefit of using archaic offline technology is that it can’t be hacked. Indeed, the Galactica’s ban on newer networked computers was a key defence against the Cylons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But change is inevitable. Maintaining an old system becomes more burdensome than embracing the new. I’ll admit, I’m too obsessed with getting the latest and greatest. Which is why I’m a bit jarred when I come across people who cling to the old and familiar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Microsoft is ending support for Windows 7 at the end of this year, and oh boy, is it causing problems. I was casually asked by a Windows 7 stalwart how long it will keep working for. Another year? Another five years? Honestly, I didn’t know how to answer. At work, some of our customers in the fishing industry are so fed up with having to use Windows machines that they’re asking us to bring back analog tech from the early 90s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t say I blame anyone for wanting to stick with what works, but Microsoft should really make the Windows 10 upgrade free again if they want to convert the last stubborn holdouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, there’s a lesson for me to learn here - I need to pump the brakes because new isn’t always better. For instance, I’ve recently been bitten hard by Apple with their disastrously buggy iOS 13 and Catalina software updates.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Thank you Jony Ive</title>
      <link>https://wordbit.com/posts/thank-you-jony-ive/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Unless you move in astoundingly different circles than I do, you will have heard by now that Jonathan Ive is leaving Apple. I must admit, the news took me by surprise. I’ve long taken it for granted that Apple’s products were essentially Jony’s products - meticulously fussed over and shepherded into existence by one of the greatest - if not the greatest - industrial designers of our time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/06/jony-ive-to-form-independent-design-company-with-apple-as-client/&#34;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, Apple emphasized that he’ll still be working with Apple as an independent consultant. But, given Apple’s closed-off monastic work culture, this overture seems nothing more than an empty gesture to appease the stock market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reality is, after a 27-year tenure, Ive is out. He is gracefully leaving Apple behind and handing the reins of design-team leadership to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ripples from Ive’s decision surfaced some predictably snarky reporting, but I don’t really want to get into it. For a more measure take on Jony’s departure, check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/02/apple-sans-ive/&#34;&gt;Mathew Panzarino’s piece&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far from being a deity, Jony is a flawed human being, just like all of us, and certainly just as Steve Jobs was. I may, for instance, never forgive a snobbish Jony for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/jony-ive-is-horrified-by-how-most-modern-cars-look-2015-2&#34;&gt;calling my Toyota Echo&lt;/a&gt; “baffling” and “insipid”. But I’ll &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordbit.com/posts/apples-jonathan-ive/&#34;&gt;never cease to be amazed&lt;/a&gt; by his focus and his commitment to the design process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is one trait that exemplifies not only Jony’s design philosophy, but his entire life, it is this: perseverance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The darkest timeline - part four</title>
      <link>https://wordbit.com/posts/the-darkest-timeline-part-four/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The overwhelming stench of rotting garbage and vomit pulled Nathan out of his stupor. His dream, half-remembered, lingered blue and sparkling — like the shimmer of the ocean. The dream left him with a vague sense of joy, dissipating quickly as he opened his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His tangled dirt-caked hair was covering his face; he clumsily smoothed it away. He was lying in a dumpster on a putrid bed of refuse. Must have passed out here last night, he thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scrambling out of the bin, Nathan headed down an alley to the street corner. It was bitterly cold and he was starving. People were bustling to and fro, the soft light of their holographic heads-up displays lending a demonic red hue to their faces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the building walls were nothing more than blank slabs of dirty concrete in reality, he knew that the ubiquitous heads-up display worn by every passerby projected the bright lights and festive decorations of virtual store windows to everybody except him. The projections were part of an exclusive fantasy world he was no longer a part of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only real-life clue that it was the holiday season was a morose Salvation-Army Santa droid standing on the corner ringing a bell and soliciting donations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The flub at Dub Dub</title>
      <link>https://wordbit.com/posts/the-flub-at-dub-dub/</link>

      <guid>https://wordbit.com/posts/the-flub-at-dub-dub/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every June, like clockwork, along comes allergies and WWDC (colloquially known as “Dud Dub” in Apple parlance - a horrible moniker which reminds of George W. Bush).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re jaded and don’t care anymore - I get it, but I always look forward to seeing what’s coming up on the software roadmap. It’s easy to forget that Apple used to charge for software updates on the Mac and even on the iPod. Free updates are always welcome, and despite the conspiracy theories, I don’t believe Apple ever willfully intends to slow down the hardware with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a lot crammed into the keynote - with an expanding portfolio of devices, Apple didn’t want to leave any product out. As a result, there wasn’t an overarching theme - just a barrage of software improvements, many weirdly addressing, point-by-point, criticisms from product reviews on major tech sites such as &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was also a big product reveal - the new Mac Pro, a ridiculous beast of a machine for&amp;hellip;who exactly? Who actually needs a 28-core CPU and 1.5 terabytes of RAM?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not anyone who is starting a home business and needs to get up and running on a shoestring. Not even the hobbyists who like to build overclocked PCs and brag about their liquid-nitrogen cooling systems. No, the Mac Pro is for the major players - such as an established video production company with a bottomless IT budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing epitomizes this divide more than &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuW4Suo4OVg&#34;&gt;that infamous moment&lt;/a&gt; when Apple lost the crowd and sparked off an unfortunate wave of media coverage that somewhat overshadowed an otherwise excellent keynote.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Five random things</title>
      <link>https://wordbit.com/posts/five-random-things/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2019 16:35:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://wordbit.com/posts/five-random-things/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey there dear reader - thanks for stopping by! We’re already five months into 2019, but this is the first blog post of the year, so I’m here to regale you with some delightfully random topics of interest. After all, we’re both here for a bit of entertainment aren’t we? A break from the relentless flow of our lives. Time never slows, and there are things in this world we should talk about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we jump into it, I’d like to assure you that I’m alive and well, despite once again failing to keep up my end of the post-once-a-month bargain. I will also assure you that I will never mention this particular failing again, lest every post begins with another lame apology and an empty promise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said that, my focus this year has been on developing some healthy fitness and eating habits. And, despite a setback every now and then, I’ve stuck with it since January. I know it’s working because the notch progression on my belt has reversed direction and my pants now look scrunched up at the waist and ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, my previous doctor told me to drink more red wine. I ignored him. And then my next doctor also told me to drink red wine - and eat unsalted almonds - or he would put me on cholesterol-lowering medication. He gave me until December to turn the ship around. Well, I don’t want to go on meds, but I don’t want to start a drinking habit either. So I eat lots of almonds now. And less chips and chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll blame my high bad cholesterol / low good cholesterol as the impetus for my recent lifestyle changes, but the truth is - I’m getting old folks. And writers have the most sedentary lifestyle of all. We don’t even get up very often to go into meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, enough idle chatter - I’ve put together a few random things you should know about in 2019 - after the break.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My first VR experience</title>
      <link>https://wordbit.com/posts/my-first-vr-experience/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 04 Dec 2018 19:20:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://wordbit.com/posts/my-first-vr-experience/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was a cold, grey day in November. We huddled in our coats as we scuttled past the empty loading bays of an industrial area. Two men smoking outside the entrance to a seedy pool hall stared at us with open suspicion as we searched for a sign we were in the right place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The VR lounge was hard to find, but we eventually found the entrance nested within a cluster of Chinese businesses. It was beside an extraordinarily picturesque reflexology foot spa filled with intricate wooden carvings and an actual Buddhist temple that had been miniaturized to fit in the space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The soothing sound of running water faded away quickly as we were ushered into a den of gaming iniquity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was immediately reminded of the Internet cafés I used to frequent in the 90s. Except that nobody in here was checking email. It was grimy, dark, and reminiscent of one of those sci-fi movies where the protagonist stumbles into a room of bodies hooked into the matrix or the inception dream world or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We shelled out some serious dough for a one-hour VR session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were shown to some empty cubicles in the back, with nothing but HTC Vive headsets hanging down by their umbilicals from the ceiling. A taciturn attendant briskly strapped on the headset and placed the controllers in my hands. Another helped my wife get set up. I heard him ask, “We doing the tutorial?” The other guy answered: “Yep”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he said “Look to your right” and just like that, I was floating in a white room with a droid walking me through the mechanics of virtual reality.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I can’t believe six months have flown by since my last post. I’ve experienced some shame over this state of affairs, I’ll admit. But beneath the shame lies… ambivalence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And lack of time, I suppose. A flimsy excuse, I know, as I could make more time to tap away on my beautiful underused MacBook Pro instead of fruitlessly trying to catch up on an endless and ever-expanding Netflix queue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet - I’m trying not to feel bad about it. It’s okay to take care of your life before you take care of your writing. It’s okay to take care of your children, your mental health, or whatever your responsibilities and obligations to yourself and others are. We both know that. Of course nobody is cracking a whip here, least of all you, gentle reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I do think that it’s beneficial to stretch those blogging muscles at least once a month, so I’ll try make more of an effort, or risk stagnation of what I consider a core skill of mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s time to get those creative juices flowing - to go ahead and try - even if it hurts and the results are terrible. Just starting is the hard part. I can’t even tell you how many times I’ve tried to start writing a post then just given up in a fit of despair. Sounds dramatic, but then, how else do you describe a “fit of despair”?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Google Duplex</title>

      <guid>https://wordbit.com/posts/google-duplex/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ll admit it - I haven’t been following the tech industry as zealously as I used to. Scanning through every tech headline in the news has only led to a vague sense of listlessness, followed by disappointment, and ending with boredom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That hunger for “the next big thing” can’t really be satisfied by snacking on my RSS feed. Deep dives into emerging tech are more satisfying, but I don’t really have the time to read &lt;em&gt;Wired Magazine&lt;/em&gt; from cover to cover anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look, I’m not about to go on one of those tech detox programs where you whine about smartphone addiction and proselytize over the benefits of a tech-free life from your surfboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s only so long I can think about the notch, especially now that they are popping up on Android phones as well (get back to me when there are no more notches on any more phones, and we’ll talk).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s only so long I can shake my head at Facebook as they sell our online identities to nefarious third parties on one day, then announce a goddamn dating service on the next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s only so long I can listen to Elon Musk prattle on about going to Mars while failing to deliver on the Model 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, there isn’t a lot to be enthusiastic about in 2018 so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then Sundar Pichai stood on up on the amphitheatre stage at a Google I/O and blew my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The darkest timeline - part three</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Victor had sworn to himself that he wasn’t going to watch her again. But he couldn’t bear to sit in that soulless hotel room for one more night, agonizing over the life that was stolen from him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here he sits, on a bench across the street from the house he knows so well, watching his wife kiss another man - a stranger he’s never seen before. After their embrace ends, they clink their wine glasses and toast to some special event. Their anniversary perhaps?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marcy looks stunning in a black dress he’s never seen before, her hair done up on the top of her head. Now in her fifties, she’s always looked beautiful to him, but something was different about her. She looked healthier, more trim, and more relaxed than he’d ever seen her. His jealousy welled up in him and threatened to choke him in a hot, simmering wave. Was she happier with this other man than she was ever with him?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The micro-blog: a reappropriation</title>
      <link>https://wordbit.com/posts/the-microblog/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 26 Dec 2017 14:37:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://wordbit.com/posts/the-microblog/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A decade ago, there was a naïve delight in posting on Facebook or Twitter. Social media hadn’t yet evolved into the complex, anxiety-producing system of social currency it is today. Status updates were simply that - status updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, when Facebook opened up in 2007, you were forced to write them in the third-person: “John is baking cookies today.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no pressure to be culturally savvy or sarcastic or applause-worthy. You could be authentic, sincere, or boring if you wanted to because it all started out as a friendly little experiment. In the beginning, there were no “likes”. Can you even imagine social media without a heart or a thumbs up moderating every online interaction?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, when I came across &lt;a href=&#34;https://theoutline.com/post/2689/mastodon-makes-the-internet-feel-like-home-again&#34;&gt;this article about Mastodon&lt;/a&gt; on the Outline, I was intrigued. I’d forgotten that microblogging used to be fun. I’d also totally forgotten about Mastodon, which arrived on the scene in 2016 and seemed as doomed to fail as app.net or ello. But how could you not feel the nostalgic, warm-and-fuzzy appeal of “a nicer version of Twitter” that “makes the internet feel like home again”? And sometimes open-source initiatives in the decentralized web can flourish - just look at where Bitcoin is going these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, although the people who hang out in Mastodon instances seem just lovely (depending on the instance), the Mastodon front-end user interface is just horrible.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The darkest timeline - part two</title>
      <link>https://wordbit.com/posts/the-darkest-timeline-part-two/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The chemistry lecture was so boring I wanted to drop my head onto my desk and pass out. Even surreptitiously browsing through Twitter (as the rest of the class was doing apparently) held no appeal. I needed a Starbucks or something, anything to keep me awake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The professor droned on about the spectroscopic properties of carbon compounds. Properties I could have rattled off when I was in kindergarten. This stuff was so easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not easy being smart. As a young kid burdened with a ridiculously high IQ, I quickly learned to downplay my intelligence or face ostracism on the playground. In high school, I quietly drifted through the system, keeping my mouth shut in class rather than being labelled as the teacher’s pet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got in a lot of trouble for daydreaming. The teachers never caught on that while I was doodling in my notebook and drawing pictures of unicorns and spaceships, I was soaking in every word the teachers said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I’m in college and I’m finally free to embrace my inner geek. Unfortunately, the middle-of-nowhere small town where I live, Mountain Valley, isn’t exactly a magnet for intellectual types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The professor started talking about an experiment I was familiar with, and writing out some equations on the whiteboard. But he was getting it all wrong. Nails on a chalkboard would be less painful than watching the professor painstakingly write out the wrong equations. I couldn’t help myself - I raised my hand.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The darkest timeline - part one</title>
      <link>https://wordbit.com/posts/the-darkest-timeline-part-one/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Nov 2017 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://wordbit.com/posts/the-darkest-timeline-part-one/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking back at the past year and chastising myself for only writing half as many posts as I&amp;rsquo;d hoped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;rsquo;m going to mix it up a bit and write more fiction on this blog. I&amp;rsquo;ll start with a serialized short story with the modest goal of one &amp;ldquo;chapter&amp;rdquo; per post with no set schedule and see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll intersperse these fictional interludes with other posts as well, so I&amp;rsquo;m not going all-in on the fiction thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should warn prospective readers that any fiction on this site is probably rated R so you can expect some coarse language at the very least. Also, this is all very rough and experimental and unedited, so don&amp;rsquo;t take this as a finished piece of work - it&amp;rsquo;s just for fun. For fun, but not a necessarily a &amp;ldquo;fun&amp;rdquo; writing style because my writing tends to get really dark really quickly. I should probably work on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may know, I have a thing for time travel. So, the first story I&amp;rsquo;m starting with could be considered &lt;em&gt;Back to the Future&lt;/em&gt; fan fiction of sorts. None of the characters from this movie appear here, but I&amp;rsquo;ve shamefully ripped off the plot from &lt;em&gt;Back to the Future 2&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The genesis for this story lies in this &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/g5xs4vMx-fM&#34;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; video where Biff Tannen is replaced with Donald Trump with such eerie seamlessness. I&amp;rsquo;ve since learned, by the way, that the &lt;em&gt;Back to the Future 2&lt;/em&gt; writers intentionally based Biff&amp;rsquo;s character on Trump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-darkest-timeline&#34;&gt;darkest timeline meme&lt;/a&gt; has also contributed to the thought process behind this story. And a weird dream, which I won&amp;rsquo;t go into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Back to the Future&lt;/em&gt; films, Marty McFly jumps back in time 30 years from 1985 to 1955 and also 30 years forward in time from 1985 to 2015. I thought it would be fun for a protagonist in 2015 to jump back in time to 1985 to experience all the amusingly anachronistic quirks of another era. It&amp;rsquo;s funny, and more than a little disturbing, to think of the 80s as another era because I lived through that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this preamble is now longer than part one of my story, so I&amp;rsquo;d best begin.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Thoughts on the iPhone X</title>
      <link>https://wordbit.com/posts/iphone-x/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordbit.com/posts/2015-flagship-winner/&#34;&gt;iPhone 6S&lt;/a&gt; shows no signs of aging, so I’m not looking to upgrade any time soon. But even if I was, the iPhone X is not a phone I would buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not because it is a terrible product - the reviews have been borderline sycophantic. Nor because it is too radical - I would almost certainly pass over the iPhone 8 as being too similar to the 6S to justify an upgrade. Not even the high price phases me, which most reviewers cite as the main drawback of the X. After paying $1200 for my last iPhone (to upgrade the piss-poor entry-level memory from 16GB to 64GB), an extra $200 doesn’t seem that hard to swallow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And no, I have no compelling reason to switch back to Android at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I wouldn’t buy this phone is that it may be “the future of the smartphone”, but it is not “the smartphone of the future.” It is a precursor to perfection. A signpost pointing to greatness a few years from now. And I thank all those who bought it for alpha testing my future phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are my thoughts. Let’s start with the hardware design, which is most important because, unlike software, it cannot change in this iteration of the device.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ill communication</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Google Home is Canada’s first official smart speaker, so I couldn’t resist pre-ordering one when it landed in the True North. Being an early adopter is definitely out of character for me - I think this is the first product I’ve ever pre-ordered. Anyway, I’ve been using it for a few months now. Here are my thoughts so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main draw of the Google Home is the ability to converse with the Google Assistant. Ambient computing, as it is called by some, is a cool sci-fi concept and, along with the flip phone and the tablet, is another Star Trek crossover from fantasy into reality. A lots of geeks out there love the idea of leaning back in their captain’s chair with a cup of Earl Grey and barking out “computer!” to chat with an AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is, in real life, you aren’t running a starship. And to run your household seamlessly through voice control, the Internet of Things (IoT) needs to catch up to the future. Right now it is a tangled mess of incompatible competing platforms. A case in point - Siri doesn’t seem to have a problem controlling my Philips Hue smart bulbs, but Google does. The Google Assistant cheerily assures me the lights are off, but they stubbornly stay on, proving that even an artificial intelligence can lie.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Design shifts</title>
      <link>https://wordbit.com/posts/design-shifts/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although I deal more in words than aesthetics, I have a deep appreciation of design - especially architectural, industrial, and UI design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have an extra appreciation for a fully-realized and well-documented design language. When I was tasked to design a user interface, for example, I found that Google&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://material.io/guidelines/&#34;&gt;documentation for their Material Design&lt;/a&gt; to be an invaluable resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently upgraded to Windows 10 on my work machine and I am enjoying the fresh coat of &amp;ldquo;Metro&amp;rdquo; paint. But I have to say that Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s newly-announced &lt;a href=&#34;http://fluent.microsoft.com/&#34;&gt;Fluent Design&lt;/a&gt; feels far more like the future. And I mean that literally, because the future of computing may very well take place in augmented reality, or mixed reality as some now prefer to call it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is a counterpoint to the so-called ambient computing environment (presided over by virtual assistants such as the Amazon Echo&amp;rsquo;s Alexa), then this is it. Or maybe we are moving toward a fusion of these two UI paradigms?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fluent Design is clearly an attempt to establish some design fundamentals in a 3D environment. But, there is also a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IDfVR1qbUG_NDH0x0_jP4ZPMle4=/0x0:787x425/1200x800/filters:focal(332x151:456x275)/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/54744111/holographicdesktop1.0.jpg&#34;&gt;sparse Desktop concept&lt;/a&gt; floating out there that looks amazing. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to a more defined design language as Fluent Design moves out of the concept and into the implementation phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said that, is it time for the pendulum to swing away from the clean, minimalist trend of the past decade and back toward colour and chaos?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;About twenty years ago, when I was a student, I lived in an old apartment building on a busy main street. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t in a good neighbourhood. The dudes in the building across from us appeared to be drug dealers and would beg us for smokes every time we went on the balcony - even though we never had any damn smokes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the rent was cheap. I had a roommate, and each of us chipped in less than $300 a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That summer was the worst. The building was a rotting carcass that smelled sickening when the sun baked its cracked wooden siding. And even with the windows closed - which only made the smell worse - the noise from the traffic roaring by never ceased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had an early bedtime that summer because I was working at the Canadian Tire warehouse and had to wake up at 5 AM to make the bus on time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I didn&amp;rsquo;t get much sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ten years of wordbit</title>
      <link>https://wordbit.com/posts/wordbit-ten-anniversary/</link>

      <guid>https://wordbit.com/posts/wordbit-ten-anniversary/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago today, &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordbit.com/posts/what-is-a-wordbit-anyway/&#34;&gt;wordbit joined the blogosphere&lt;/a&gt;. A few years after that, the term &lt;em&gt;blogosphere&lt;/em&gt; joined other buzzwords such as &lt;em&gt;web 2.0&lt;/em&gt; in the internet fad graveyard. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping &lt;em&gt;social media&lt;/em&gt; will be joining them at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But ten years ago, social media was still fun and innocent. Heck - ten years ago, there were no smartphones. The iPhone was to debut about four months later in a defining moment that changed the trajectory of the internet forever. Three years later, in 2010, &lt;em&gt;Wired Magazine&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wired.com/2010/08/ff_webrip/&#34;&gt;declared that &amp;ldquo;the Web is dead&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. The Web, in case you didn&amp;rsquo;t know, meaning the World Wide Web (WWW) - a collection of html pages served up in desktop browsers. The Web&amp;rsquo;s death was greatly exaggerated of course - you can thank responsive web design for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then again, there are millions of people who use Facebook but &lt;a href=&#34;https://qz.com/333313/milliions-of-facebook-users-have-no-idea-theyre-using-the-internet/&#34;&gt;have no idea that Facebook exists on the Internet&lt;/a&gt;. Zuckerberg hooked even the most technophobic on the Internet without them even knowing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, the world is a different place - but where does that leave the humble blog?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A foray into fitness tracking</title>
      <link>https://wordbit.com/posts/a-foray-into-fitness-tracking/</link>

      <guid>https://wordbit.com/posts/a-foray-into-fitness-tracking/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shelling out for a fitness tracker in January seems like a cliché. Yet, here I am - shelling out for a fitness tracker. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a New Year&amp;rsquo;s resolution to get in shape, and I&amp;rsquo;m not planning on buying one of those ill-fated gym memberships that everybody regrets signing up for after one too many holiday pig-outs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is true though that I haven&amp;rsquo;t gone running for a while. I entirely blame the anomalous snowy weather we&amp;rsquo;ve been having on the West Coast for that. I also know that a fitness tracker won&amp;rsquo;t work miracles in getting my butt off the couch - only good old-fashioned discipline can do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess buying my first fitness tracker just kind of happened.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The new old MacBook Pro</title>
      <link>https://wordbit.com/posts/the-new-old-macbook-pro/</link>

      <guid>https://wordbit.com/posts/the-new-old-macbook-pro/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;About that MacBook Pro I had my eye on. I couldn’t wait. As much as I appreciate all my iMac has done for me, I just couldn’t listen to the endless spinning and chirping of that dreadful hard drive for another year without going insane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll admit, I was hoodwinked at first by the narrative spun by a few entitled tech journalists. It had been two years since the MacBook Pro was last updated in early 2015. People were hungry for a new mac. That is why the general disappointment was all the more compounded when the new MacBook Pros were released recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professionals bemoaned the lack of bleeding edge CPUs and a limit of 16GB of RAM, because they all of course need at least 32GB (dude, please). And recreational users (like me) winced hard at the sky-high price increase. An increase, no doubt, resulting from the addition of a questionable touch bar added to replace the function keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I came to another realization. A realization that perhaps did not enter the minds of most tech pundits who begrudge the steep price for being an early adopter, but then pay it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, well, well. A lot has happened since I last posted here. In short, the world has become a darker place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gentle rustle of leaves swaying in the summer breeze has been replaced with the dry death rattle of winter winds. Leonard Cohen released his final magnificent album and then breathed his last breath. America had a trainwreck of an election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I haven’t even got to Apple’s disappointing MacBook Pros yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was a bad joke by the way. Or maybe it wasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a personal note, I failed to post anything in September or October - thus betraying the promise (well, more of &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordbit.com/pages/about/&#34;&gt;a mild-mannered suggestion&lt;/a&gt; really) to you of at least a monthly post. In my defense, I’ve been stressed out with moving. And with the kids starting new school and daycare schedules. Also, I turned 40 and became an old crotchety man overnight. The motivation to write is pretty low right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just getting this far feels like jerking one clunky wooden leg in front of the other and breathing hard. Hard.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The greatest real estate opportunity on planet Earth</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;All you savvy investors out there must know by now that you can make ridiculous amounts of money in Vancouver real estate. Those who bought a few years ago are doing VERY well for themselves. We thought this wild ride couldn’t last, but prices keep going up and up and up, with no end to the gravy train in sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that’s not really true - there have been rumblings in the media about bubbles popping, or some such nonsense, but let me assure you: there is still money to be made. Even for all you foreign investors saddled with that 15 percent tax&amp;hellip; My advice is - ignore the tax, my friends. 15 percent is nothing, NOTHING, compared to the gains you will make in the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you why.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s a beautiful Sunday afternoon in the middle of July - a pleasant breeze blows and it isn&amp;rsquo;t sweltering like it was last summer. I&amp;rsquo;m leaning up against a log on the south side of Queen&amp;rsquo;s Park and writing this post on my iPad. The Patullo Bridge is closed this weekend for seismic upgrades, so this area of the park is unusually serene - the drone of traffic crossing the bridge into Surrey is delightfully absent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The groundskeepers tend to ignore this part of the park because it is seldom frequented. It has a slightly unkempt, natural look  - unlike the manicured gardens to the North where happy young couples take wedding pictures in the rose garden. I like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s nothing like sitting quietly in nature. I feel rejuvenated and at peace. Green spaces quench the thirsty soul and wash away the thick stench of the city. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t imagine how unhappy I&amp;rsquo;d feel if I lived in the middle of an urban wasteland. A concrete prison with an apartment window looking at a brick wall and a cubicle at work with no windows at all. I guess a lot of people live that way, which explains a lot about all the aggression and stress in this world.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Unlike Google and the other guys, there was no talk of AI or bots at Apple’s software showcase this year. Instead, Apple was true to form, highlighting aspects like “differential privacy” and “continuity” - features that keep you locked into their ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the event was fairly low key with Apple focused on improving and polishing rather than innovating (I think it was the announcement of universal cut and paste that got the biggest round of applause).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, I always enjoy sitting down to watch the two-hour infomercial that is the keynote - if only to see what free stuff I’m going to get. Remember when Apple actually charged for software upgrades? It’s way more fun to watch these things &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; you’ve sold your kidney for Apple hardware. There is no angst at WWDC - only benefits for those who have already paid the Apple tax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the keynote was divided into four software platforms, I’ll do the same and comment on each one individually.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Google I/O 2016</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I sat down to watch this year’s I/O keynote, I couldn’t &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordbit.com/posts/rise-of-the-google-machine/&#34;&gt;help but recall&lt;/a&gt; last year’s incredible gift to the Google faithful - Google Photos. Free unlimited uploads in their full resolution for pictures under 16MP. It was, and still is, an amazing service. It even uploads Live Photos on my iPhone 6S - something that even iCloud’s photostream doesn’t do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a few years from now, Google will hold our bloated photo libraries hostage in exchange for our souls, but so far this hasn’t happened. And maybe when it does happen, we’ll willingly pay the price. It&amp;rsquo;s so easy to become addicted to the machine learning that organizes our pictures and creates photo albums for us; machine learning that can identify the content of every photo. How could you not love searching for “hugs” to view all those pictures of your loved ones engaged in a warm embrace?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year there were no surprise gifts, but Google continued to show off its burgeoning AI prowess. A new messaging app was shown with eerie “smart replies” that allows the AI to answer in your stead.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear user,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve never met, but I write to you every day. Writing to you is my job, but still, I do care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It starts with the small things. Knowing the frustration of ambiguity, I try to choose the perfect words for you. I painstakingly pore over both our company’s Language Guide, as well as the latest Simplified Technical English specification to ensure I am not using any forbidden words. I also try to use terminology consistently, so that I don’t give the same part two different names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also never use the word &amp;ldquo;utilize&amp;rdquo;. Although, to my abject horror, one instance did slip through when I copied some text from the Sales and Marketing department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then craft the perfect sentences - not too long, not too complex, but with delightful variations in syntactic structure so that you don’t get bored. I polish these sentences so that they are as smooth and round as a river stone, and can therefore be reused in multiple contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tesla&#39;s Model 3</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tesla’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.teslamotors.com/model3&#34;&gt;Model 3&lt;/a&gt; is not only a jaw-droppingly stylish car, it is also a compelling window into a future world where the electric car is king.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It certainly has anyone who is interested in technology and design drooling. Tesla’s electric cars come across as gadgets, complete with over-the-air software upgrades - not boring utilitarian vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the Model 3 truly is a product of the tech industry. It’s also an eccentric genius billionaire’s baby. Which makes Tesla a truly unique company, and the Model 3 an astoundingly fresh entrant in a stale car industry. An industry, by the way, that last saw true innovation over a hundred years ago with the debut of Henry Ford’s Model T.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But is the Model 3 really a vision of the future, or merely a mirage?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a poignant moment in &lt;em&gt;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&lt;/em&gt; when the Holy Grail crosses the Great Seal and triggers the collapse of the Temple of the Sun. The earth is torn asunder, and Elsa, a Nazi agent and Austrian archaeologist, loses her life. After Indiana Jones fails to save her, he ends up hanging precariously in the crevice himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indiana’s father catches his hand and tries to pull him to safety. But, with his other hand, Indiana tries to reach the Holy Grail, which rests tantalizingly on a narrow ledge nearby. He can almost reach it; his fingertips brush it. But his father cannot hold on as oily sweat causes their hands to slip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indiana’s father (so aptly played by Sean Connery), says, in a soft, gentle voice: “Indiana… Indiana… let it go”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he does. As Indiana rides into the sunset and John William’s theme song swells over the closing credits, we knew it really was his last crusade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we were wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Kanye West&amp;rsquo;s new album, &lt;em&gt;The Life of Pablo&lt;/em&gt;, is fantastic. At least, that&amp;rsquo;s what people who&amp;rsquo;ve signed up for Tidal say. Because Jay Z’s streaming service is the only place you can get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except for, of course, other illicit means. But we’ll get to that later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, after the album’s release, Kanye crowed on Twitter that his album will never be available on Apple Music (or on CDs for that matter).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It feels like the West Coast vs East Coast rivalry all over again. We have Apple Music on the West Coast, with Dr. Dre and friends. Then we have Jay Z and crew representing the East Coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, should I say, the metaphorical East Coast. Because it’s not like Jay Z or Kanye actually live in the godforsaken east. They live in California of course, along with everybody else famous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But clearly, Kanye does not want to attend any more parties in L.A. So, what gives?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The nightmares in our DNA</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure you are familiar with the “nature vs nurture” debate. If not, google it - I’ll wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got it? Good. For me, most explanations for human behaviour can be lumped into the “nurture” side - a bias, no doubt, fostered by my time studying anthropology at university.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is something to be said for the “nature” side as well. Evolution bakes instinctual responses into the DNA of all animals, after all. Horses, for example, have an innate fear of snakes, and therefore snake-like objects. Sometimes, a horse will rear when faced with a snake-shaped stick.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What to look forward to in 2016</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s January and most people like to write about New Year resolutions, or predictions for the year ahead. But I’m quite tired. And no, I didn’t mean that to sound like a sardonic riff of a &lt;em&gt;Flight of the Conchords&lt;/em&gt; song. I just feel like writing something more free flowing and fun that requires less research, intense pondering or tortured introspection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I’m going to compile a breezy list of things I’m looking forward to in 2016. Just off the top of my head. And in no particular order. Yes, the year ahead will bring weddings and babies (not mine, just to be clear), which is all very exciting of course. And I have a new job to sink my teeth into, which is very satisfying. I also want to be… better in 2016, in many ways. But forget about that for now. Let’s talk about music, tech, movies, games, books, and that sort of superficial, but fun, fluffy stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, since I have a five-hour layover here in Amsterdam, I may as well rustle together some thoughts on my trip to Norway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only reason for my visit was for work, so let me start with my time at Kongsberg Maritime. After an unsuccessful attempt at using DITA at VTech, I was a little skeptical about plunging into structured authoring, although I was willing to learn the tools of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Ragnar, the senior information developer over there, put me through a DITA boot camp where he promised I would eat, sleep, and dream of XML and DITA. And I did. So, did I emerge a DITA disciple, ready to spread the word at home?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2015 Flagship winner</title>

      <guid>https://wordbit.com/posts/2015-flagship-winner/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The choice came down to four phones: the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordbit.com/posts/2015-flagship-1-htc-one-m9/&#34;&gt;HTC One M9&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordbit.com/posts/2015-flagship-2-samsung-galaxy-s6/&#34;&gt;Samsung Galaxy S6&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordbit.com/posts/1271/&#34;&gt;LG G4&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordbit.com/posts/2015-flagship-4-iphone-6s/&#34;&gt;iPhone 6s&lt;/a&gt;. In actuality, a more stark dichotomy lay between Android and Apple, so the choice really came down to two very different approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been living with both Android and iOS, so appreciate the merits of both operating systems. For me, hardware was a bigger consideration, as well as ongoing software support. I also didn&amp;rsquo;t want a gigantic slab of a phone that seems to be the norm these days. So, in the end, I decided to go with the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I blog about work very sparely, and I think most people would agree that saying too much can lead into dangerous territory. So, I tend to avoid it unless I have something general to say that doesn&amp;rsquo;t touch on any work projects. But I would be remiss in my blogging duties not to mention that I have a new job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started working as a technical writer at Vtech seven years ago - here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordbit.com/posts/new-job/&#34;&gt;a post&lt;/a&gt; I wrote when I first got the job, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordbit.com/posts/what-i-do/&#34;&gt;another&lt;/a&gt; I wrote about a month in.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Seeing as I don’t make any money off this blog, I try to keep costs down to a minimum. And so, for the past eight years or so, I’ve had no problems using a free web host to manage my self-hosted Wordpress installation. Until now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been pretty busy these days (for reasons which I’ll explain in a later post). But, wanting to post at least once a month, I navigated over to wordbit.com only to discover an ugly 403 error page instead of my home page.  So, I contacted my web host support. This is what happened:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2015 Flagship 4: iPhone 6S</title>

&lt;p&gt;As I alluded to in my last post, the very definition of a &amp;ldquo;flagship&amp;rdquo; has perceptively shifted this past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, mid-range devices with high-end specs and razor-thin profit margins have exploded out of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the definition of a flagship has skewed heavily toward &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; phones (formerly known as phablets, but now the norm). Bigger phones tend to get better battery life and are able to fit in better camera components, such as Optical Image Stabilization (OIS).  But, I most certainly do not want a big phone. For me, the sweet spot is in the 4.5 to 5-inch screen size range. For this reason, I&amp;rsquo;m excluding phones like the Note 5 and iPhone 6S Plus from my overview of the year&amp;rsquo;s best.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a long, dry summer - and I&amp;rsquo;m not just talking about the weather. My series on flagship phones has been somewhat stymied by some recent changes in the industry. I was expecting some more flagships to emerge from big boys like Sony and Motorola, but instead there has been a surge of mid-range devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After finding all their money was being made on the entry-level Moto G, Motorola decided to scale back on an ambitious successor to last year&amp;rsquo;s Moto X.  Instead we have the Moto X Play, which is nothing more than a pumped-up version of the Moto G with mid-range specs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been excited to try out Lollipop for a long time, especially after delving deep into Google&amp;rsquo;s new design language, dubbed Material Design, and even using it in my own user interface design projects. But that is precisely the problem with Android, unless you&amp;rsquo;re using a Nexus, you have to wait a long, long time before getting the latest. All told, it takes roughly one year for most Android users to catch up. So, when &amp;ldquo;Android M&amp;rdquo; was announced, I knew my time was near. Except, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, WWDC 2015 (Apple&amp;rsquo;s developer conference) showcased what&amp;rsquo;s new in OS X, iOS, and watchOS. There was also an unsurprising &amp;ldquo;one more thing&amp;rdquo; with the introduction of Apple Music. Unlike the massive redesign from&lt;a href=&#34;https://wordbit.com/posts/its-a-sunny-day-in-cupertino/&#34;&gt; last year&lt;/a&gt;, it was a pretty low-key affair, with Apple focusing on tweaking and stabilizing its evolving platforms. If there was one theme that emerged from the keynote, however, it would be this: Apple is no software company.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At Google I/O last week, developments in Android M (Milkshake? Macaroon?), Android Pay, Android Wear, Internet of Things, and VR all made an appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it was Google&amp;rsquo;s advancements in machine learning that were the most impressive. The awkwardly-named &amp;ldquo;Now on Tap&amp;rdquo; in Android M exemplified these improvements nicely. Basically, Google will now offer in-context information within apps, emails, or web pages when pressing and holding the home button on your phone.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Humour has long been a staple of the Internet - in fact, you probably have some favourite delicious sites, such as the Onion or the Oatmeal, that you regularly check on for a fresh serving of laughs. But then there are those single-serving static sites that have been hosting the same joke for years and years and seem impervious to non-renewal. I wonder who keeps paying for these internet one-liners? They had their day in the sun years ago, but now languish in relative obscurity as faded internet legend.  Here are three such sites that refuse to die (and a recent one that should have died weeks ago, but didn&amp;rsquo;t).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the blossoming South Korean GDP, whether Samsung or LG triumphs is a moot point. But nonetheless, there is a cute national rivalry between these two Korean companies in their efforts to one-up each other. And it has served them well. When looking at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2996817&#34;&gt;2014 sales&lt;/a&gt;, Samsung is currently the top smartphone manufacturer in the world, and LG is in a respectable fifth place. If Samsung is the aggressive older brother, then LG comes off as the clean-cut, conservative younger brother who is extremely capable, but somewhat boring.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tens of thousands of years ago, humans would gather around the fire at night and share stories. We craved narratives to explain our world. And in the crackling fires of the darkest nights, myth and legend was born. As the oral tradition was displaced by the written word, our appetite for storytelling only increased. For thousands of years, from the Bible to Shakespeare - we&amp;rsquo;ve clung especially tight to those narratives that define the very essence of humanity, through courage, conflict, betrayal, and love.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2015 Flagship 2: Samsung Galaxy S6</title>

      <description>Before the Galaxy S6, it was easy to hate Samsung. Their slimy plastic phones looked cheap and Touchwiz was a bloated mess. Not only that, but their entire business plan seemed to revolve around blatantly ripping off Apple. So much so that they were originally fined a billion in damages in that infamous 2012 lawsuit.
But man, have they stepped up their design game this year. The S6 eschews plastic in favour of shiny glass and metal.</description>

      <description>The HTC One M9 is the first flagship of 2015, and it&amp;rsquo;s a beauty. By retaining the same curved aluminum shell and two front-facing speakers as last year&amp;rsquo;s M8, HTC is making a bold statement: We don&amp;rsquo;t need to improve on an already impeccable design. And for the most part, they&amp;rsquo;re right - if going on looks alone, there&amp;rsquo;s no doubt that this is a premium phone.
The internals, however, have been upgraded with the following specs:</description>

      <description>Everybody wants your attention. There&amp;rsquo;s an invisible war raging out there and it&amp;rsquo;s all about where you are focusing your engagement. The victor of this war gets the spoils - your precious time.
The latest player in the battle for your eyeballs is the Apple Watch. At an event on Monday, Apple revealed more details about the smartwatch (along with an obscenely thin MacBook).
Reactions to the Apple Watch event were mixed, as to be expected.</description>

      <description>At the end of this year, I&amp;rsquo;ll finally be upgrading to a new phone. After three years with the HTC One S, I&amp;rsquo;ve realized that&amp;hellip; three years is a long time. So, I&amp;rsquo;ll be skipping the entry-level and mid-tier phones and just shell out for a flagship. For a device you use everyday, it&amp;rsquo;s worth getting the best.
I&amp;rsquo;ll be blogging about all the flagship contenders that come out this year in a series of blog posts, then decide on the winner by December.</description>

      <description>Cars are so integral to American culture, that it&amp;rsquo;s no surprise they often appear in Hollywood movies about the future. But with self-driving cars rapidly gaining traction (sorry) in the public imagination, we are getting a better idea of what a realistic future of autonomous vehicles may look like. So, the question is, which science fiction movies got it right, and who got it wrong?
Before we can answer this question, we need to establish a few things.</description>

      <description>I tried to think of a Buzzfeed-worthy headline and this is all I could come up with. The truth is I hate most self-improvement articles (or are they calling them &amp;ldquo;life hacks&amp;rdquo; these days?) even though I still read them. But I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write one anyway because I&amp;rsquo;m all grown up now and am supposed to have accumulated a modicum of wisdom.
I&amp;rsquo;m under no illusion that young people everywhere are clamoring for advice on the internet.</description>

      <description>The ultimate dystopian future has to be the one where the culmination of Virtual Reality (VR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) results in our unwitting enslavement by a machine mind. Fifteen years ago, The Matrix nailed it brilliantly:
In this - dare I say - cult classic, the god-like AI, having far surpassed humanity&amp;rsquo;s cognitive abilities, views people as nothing more than a power source. To maintain control over us, the AI creates the ultimate VR simulation.</description>

      <description>Ah, January. A new year always brings on a fresh batch of fresh-faced fools who hit the road hard until fading back into obscurity by February. Don&amp;rsquo;t judge me as a snob - I don&amp;rsquo;t find pleasure in bragging about every run I take by posting a map of my running route on Facebook (yes, people actually do this).
But at least allow me to establish my credibility. I&amp;rsquo;ve been running regularly three days a week for the past five years.</description>

      <description>Here we are, at the end of 2014, and it is not a good time to buy a new phone. Flagship phones have steadily ballooned in size to the point where they&amp;rsquo;ve morphed into phablets, effectively killing the small tablet market. This year&amp;rsquo;s Nexus has a gigantic 6-inch screen. Google discontinued their 7-inch tablets to make room in the market for this beast. Apple hedged their bets by launching both a 4.</description>

      <description>This post contains spoilers (at the end). Read on at your own risk.
Interstellar takes on black holes, relativity, and the politics of space exploration - grounding these topics in an emotional and gut-wrenching family drama. It&amp;rsquo;s a great movie.
Among the various weighty philosophical questions posed in this Christopher Nolan epic, one stands out - are we alone in the universe? I&amp;rsquo;d like to frame the movie around this question alone.</description>

      <description>October is when most companies hope to grab some mindshare in the run-up to the Christmas shopping season. These days, I&amp;rsquo;m mostly interested in what Google and Apple have to offer. But there are some intriguing developments blossoming elsewhere as well. Here are my thoughts.
Let&amp;rsquo;s start with Apple - this month they announced the iPad Air 2 and an iMac with a Retina 5K display. It&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that bigger smartphones are slowly squeezing iPads out of the market.</description>

      <description>The 90s was a great decade for music. Grunge music spread that rainy, depressing Seattle vibe across the planet, and rap took off in a big way thanks to hyper-local artists like Dr. Dre making sure even kids in Africa knew where Compton was.
Perhaps all you can recall of the 90s is the Nirvana-Pearl Jam-Soundgarden trifecta, which is all good, but there&amp;rsquo;s so much great music you&amp;rsquo;ve probably missed out on.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;One more thing&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; he said, evoking the classic Steve Jobs catchphrase for the first time since Steve&amp;rsquo;s death. Tim Cook&amp;rsquo;s excitement was palpable, his voice shaking with emotion. When he introduced the Apple Watch as the next step in Apple&amp;rsquo;s story, I believed. Apple was about to change the world again.
Of course, after all that hyperbole, the big reveal was a huge disappointment. I guess I was expecting the unexpected, and didn&amp;rsquo;t get it.</description>

      <description>How much do you really know about your ancestors? Were they good or evil? What traits were handed down through generations until they were bestowed upon you - the unique individual reading these words now? This is a question that has piqued the curiosity of many amateur historians and custodians of the family tree. Even if your ancestors made it into the history books, these so-called historical facts are often biased and skewed toward a particular cultural worldview.</description>

      <description>About two months after flashing my ROM, I encountered my first serious bug. Basically, the software wouldn&amp;rsquo;t recognize my WiFi radio. This issue wasn&amp;rsquo;t actually a big deal because I have unlimited data. In fact, my battery life improved somewhat. But, I wanted to fix it anyway so I found the issue on Cyanogenmod&amp;rsquo;s bug tracking wiki, called JIRA. I up-voted the bug and set an email alert on it. Other users weighed in and the issue was eventually resolved by a developer.</description>

      <description>At the height of the long wet summer of the Seventy-Seventh Year of Sendovani, the Thiefmaker of Camorr paid a sudden and unannounced visit to the Eyeless Priest at the Temple of Perelandro, desperately hoping to sell him the Lamora boy.
‘Have I got a deal for you!’ the Thiefmaker began, perhaps inauspiciously.
‘Another deal like Calo and Galdo, maybe?’ said the Eyeless Priest. ‘I’ve still got my hands full training those giggling idiots out of every bad habit they picked up from you and replacing them with the bad habits I need.</description>

Rdio is the other excellent streaming service available in Canada, but costs $10 a month.
With the unlimited data plan I have with WIND Mobile, I now have unfettered access to millions of songs on demand.</description>

Google everywhere - on your phone, on your computer, on your TV, in your car, on your body, at your work, even in developing countries teeming with future customers frothing at the bit to get a smartphone. Google wants to aggressively expand and rapid expansion always brings messiness. The keynote definitely reflected this: there were protesters heckling the presenters. Demo fails. Kinetic art. It was a carnival.</description>

      <description>This morning&amp;rsquo;s keynote at Apple&amp;rsquo;s WWDC was all about sharing. And sharing is good, as any mother will tell her three-year old. But in a brilliant play by Apple, the true impetus behind all this sharing is a calculated effort to keep developers on-board and users locked into their ecosystem.
The relaxed smiles on the faces of Tim Cook and Craig Federighi belie the fact that these public presentations are actually highly scripted performances designed to counter negative public perception and set a new tone for the future.</description>

 I&amp;rsquo;m trying to think of a good analogy. When we were an agrarian nation, all cars were trucks. But as people moved more towards urban centers, people started to get into cars. I think PCs are going to be like trucks.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been lamenting the dearth of software upgrades on my HTC One S for a while now. Over the past year or so I&amp;rsquo;ve been happy to simulate a stock experience by using Nova launcher, along with some custom UI tweaks. But under the hood, a sense-infused Jelly Bean 4.1.1 was starting to show its age. Sluggish response times were easily solved through a factory reset, but this wasn&amp;rsquo;t nearly satisfying enough.</description>

      <description>There is something fascinating about a forgotten place. Especially in our ever-changing urban landscape, there is an allure in a place where time stands still. As the world rushes by, a small piece of history remains anchored amidst the human cacophony - hidden in plain sight and remembered by no-one.
The BC Penitentiary graveyard is one such place. Boxed in by low-rise condos to the south, a construction site to the west, a care home to the north and flanked by a steep escarpment to the east - it has been cut off by the world.</description>

      <description>People love Netflix - the UI is fantastic, the cross-platform support is seamless, and the price is competitive. They&amp;rsquo;re creating critically-acclaimed shows, such as House of Cards, as exclusive properties to build cachet as an HBO-style player. They kickstarted the binge-watching phenomenon and have even compelled writers to redefine the conventional narrative arc of a series in light of unconventional viewing habits. But one area where they are still sorely lacking is in bringing decent new movies to the table.</description>

Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s true that young people are no longer flocking to the library for their entertainment. Nor are they hunkering down in the depths of the night to scribble feverish midnight confessions in their journals.</description>

At the end I considered what would happen if I reached the clearing at the end of the road. That is, if I moved onto the next world. Basically, my blog would die along with me. And that made me a bit sad. So, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to create an archive of every blog post since the Livejournal days of 2003.</description>

      <description>This blog serves as an archive for my blogging activity over the years, stretching back to 2003. This blog is not regularly updated, but rather serves as a collection of posts merged from the following sources:
Dawndream (2003-2007)
wordpsace (2006-2007)
writer&amp;rsquo;s forge (2008)
wordbit version one (2007-2011)
I don&amp;rsquo;t even have an opinion (2010-2012)
Tumblr (2011-ongoing)
A Private Word (2011-ongoing)
wordbit version two (2013-ongoing)
That&amp;rsquo;s it, I think. Most of the image links are broken right now - importing doesn&amp;rsquo;t do a great job of preserving these.</description>

      <title>Wearables: immersion vs integration</title>

      <description>With Google releasing their Android Wear developer preview this week, and with their hardware partners announcing support for the platform, it feels like the wearables are starting to enter the mainstream. I say that with optimism because I think these guys are finally starting to figure out what people actually want. And when you look at the sociological big picture, it seems astoundingly obvious.
When thinking about where early wearable products have gone horribly wrong, I can&amp;rsquo;t help thinking about the sad little bluetooth headset.</description>

      <description>If you were offered a writing job where you would get paid $5 to write an article - would you take it? How about $2? How about 99 cents? How about free? If your outrage increased with each subsequent low-ball offer, then at least you have your priorities straight. But maybe you paused at free. After all, many of us write for enjoyment, or validation, or exposure, or whatever without being paid a cent.</description>

      <description>Post-apocalyptic books such as The Road, or TV shows such as The Walking Dead give us a glimpse into the aftermath of an extinction event where only tenacious bands of humans are left to cling to survival. But what if there were simulations of such scenarios - how would a mad scramble for remaining resources actually play out?
With online multiplayer games such as Day Z and Rust, we can now find out.</description>

      <description>Electrical wires wrapped around my gums
sustain the humming current in my frozen jaw
Lest words ruin the thrumming bore
I refrain from peeling away my stuck tongue.
Just one more day bleeding through stick fingers
into that cavernous library of blank-paged books.
An agonizing chess move where the rooks
checkmate endless kings in a game that lingers
far too long.</description>

      <description>On February 16th, 2007, I wrote my first post for wordbit.com, entitled What is a wordbit, anyway? That was seven years ago today - happy seventh birthday, wordbit!
I remember trying to come up with a cool domain name where I could establish my online presence, and - after much agonizing - eventually settling on &amp;ldquo;wordkit&amp;rdquo;. I actually bought wordkit.com, only to have it rejected shortly thereafter because it had been purchased by a domain squatter.</description>

      <description>With my HTC One S being frozen at Android 4.1.1, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting any more bug fixes. But Google is doing a great job of circumventing firmware upgrades by quietly updating their apps, which seem to handle a lot of the core services. For example, I&amp;rsquo;d given up on using Google Now in my car because using a bluetooth speaker with my One S just defaults to the horrid Cyberon Voice Commander app which seems to come pre-installed on most HTC phones.</description>

      <description>There is an obvious difference between blogging and an intimate late-night scribble in your diary. If you indulge in the latter you can safely assume that absolutely nobody will share in your angst or be privy to your confessions or guilty misuse of grammar and syntax. Writing in a vacuum can be a cathartic experience, but is better left to smolder in your bedside notebook or private blog.
When you write on the internet, you write in a public forum - make no mistake about that - even if nobody reads what you write, yet.</description>

      <description>Predicting the future is not just a fun exercise for the imagination - it takes an uncanny awareness, not of where the ball is, but where it&amp;rsquo;s going to land. Futurists have to marry emerging technologies with emerging market opportunities to come up with a future scenario that actually comes to be. Only in retrospect can we see whether these social scientists were fanciful fools or crackerjack seers with a remarkable talent for predicting the future.</description>

      <description>Our elevator is frequently awash in foul dog pee. But, besides from being pretty disgusting, what is interesting to me was how the initial emotional response to the pee led to increasingly refined revisions. The final word on the matter is watered-down bureaucratic drivel that won&amp;rsquo;t do much to stop the guilty party, I&amp;rsquo;m afraid.
So, here is the initial vigilante response:
This emotional response was followed up with a more tempered appeal to a witch-hunt brand of justice:</description>

      <description>I have a confession to make: I have too many lists. And I&amp;rsquo;m not just talking about to-do lists and shopping lists. I&amp;rsquo;m talking about lists of books to read, movies to watch, and games to play. Netflix queues. Amazon wishlists. App wishlists. Pocket queues.
These lists have become somewhat oppressive because there&amp;rsquo;s no way I have time to check off all these things to consume. And because new items are being added all the time, they&amp;rsquo;re basically neverending.</description>

      <description>Whether technology makes us antisocial or not is a debate that will rage on until the end of time. But, it&amp;rsquo;s too much fun to mash up a couple of images that show people in crowds ignoring each other and blame it on technology. So, in the spirit of laughing at the glass-half-empty technologist, here is a vision of the past, the present, and the future.

      <description>Kit Kat has been out for a while now and I wrote about it on launch day, but I&amp;rsquo;d like to talk more about Android phone hardware.
When the Nexus 5 came out, people were suitably enthusiastic about specs that looked great on paper. After a few weeks of real-world use, a few issues came up. The most egregious of these was a poorly optimized camera that suffered from severe shutter lag.</description>

      <description>Information overload as a sociological idea has been around since the 19th century. With the rise of urban living, it was feared that city dwellers would become jaded and unable to react to new situations. Fast forward to today. Facebook, Twitter, and RSS feeds bombard us with the raw data of a human hive mind. A smorgasbord of movies is available to watch instantly on Netflix. Spotify and other streaming music services lets you listen to any song you want.</description>

      <description>When he introduced the iPad Air in October, Tim Cook said this was &amp;ldquo;going to be an iPad Christmas,&amp;rdquo; and he was right. At least for me anyway. I mentioned recently that I was thinking of entering the tablet market. All the major players have laid down their cards for 2013 - ranging from Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Surface 2 to Lenovo&amp;rsquo;s Yoga Tablet. But then the reviews rolled in. And nobody could come close to the iPad.</description>

      <description>I am a professional writer. And like most professional writers, my income comes from writing non-fiction. For me, it&amp;rsquo;s mostly technical documents and magazine articles. For others it may be reports, press releases, proposals, business plans and so on - the usual corporate stuff that makes for a gratifying career but doesn&amp;rsquo;t really scratch the creative itch. Very few writers make money writing fiction. I once heard that only a couple of hundred authors in the world actually live off their royalties.</description>

      <description>My co-worker came across a user manual that showed a smiley face on the final page. We thought it was a gutsy move and one we could never get away with. However, while it&amp;rsquo;s not advisable to inject humour or memes into user manuals, I thought it would be great if one of our manuals ended with this:
Maybe manuals would do a better job at capturing the attention of the younger generation, no?</description>

      <description>Google released Kit Kat today, their latest iteration of Android, along with the Nexus 5. As a flagship nexus device, the 5 looks awesome, but I&amp;rsquo;m still not sold on LG as a manufacturer.
Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the software side first. I must admit, I was disappointed when HTC stopped supporting upgrades for my HTC One S a mere 15 months after its release. But today Google revealed that it is on an 18-month obsolescence cycle, which isn&amp;rsquo;t much better I guess.</description>

      <description>I am a cord cutter. And having paid my last cable bill about two years ago, I&amp;rsquo;m never going back. Instead, I&amp;rsquo;ve opted for high-speed internet, apple TV, and Netflix. For news and sports, I&amp;rsquo;ve set up an antenna for over-the-air broadcasts of local TV stations. This arrangement works for everyone in the family. But having joined the growing group of cord cutters, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that war is coming.

      <description>The recent iPhone event was a triumph for apple&amp;rsquo;s marketing division. By putting last year&amp;rsquo;s model in a new plastic housing and adding a splash of colour, what is old is new again (iPhone 5C). And a tip of the hat can go to the engineering team for beefing up security with the fingerprint sensor (iPhone 5S). But at this year&amp;rsquo;s apple party, there was a once venerated apple device that was notably absent - the iPod.</description>

      <description>Why aren&amp;rsquo;t there more mom avatars in video gaming? I&amp;rsquo;m just throwing that out there. I haven&amp;rsquo;t done much research on this topic, but I can speculate. As the protagonist in the game&amp;rsquo;s narrative, the avatar has become more complex and interesting these days, which is great. And it seems that there are more options for female gamers, as far as customization goes. I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of the FemShep in the Mass Effect trilogy, and so on.</description>

      <description>There were no skydivers at this year&amp;rsquo;s Google I/O keynote. Nor were there any hardware announcements really, or even a new version of Android. Yet, despite a more subdued vibe, this year&amp;rsquo;s I/O was more grounded. Rich with developer tools and APIs, this year was a call to action for developers. A smart move. Google played to its strengths today: big data. And what better way to coral the developer community than handing them the keys to it.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to articulate to myself why most writing on the internet leaves me feeling hollow - my own writing included. In doing so, I&amp;rsquo;ve had to look beyond the mechanics of writing. Certainly, good writers use words judiciously and move beyond pure grammatical correctness to craft a personal style and weave a sense of play into their prose. But what&amp;rsquo;s missing is a piece of the soul.
I don&amp;rsquo;t mean soul in the spiritual sense, although there is certainly a place for that in the literary ethos.</description>

      <description> The spinning vortex of Saturn’s north polar storm resembles a deep red rose of giant proportions surrounded by green foliage in this false-color image from NASA’s Cassini spacecraft. Measurements have sized the eye at a staggering 1,250 miles (2,000 kilometers) across with cloud speeds as fast as 330 miles per hour (150 meters per second).
Space is absolutely incredible.

      <description>In case you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard: Facebook Home displays pictures from your timeline in full-screen on your Android homescreen. But, there&amp;rsquo;s a small problem with this. I think The Verge said it best: Facebook Home is beautiful, but what if your friends aren&amp;rsquo;t? The official marketing materials include sublime pics like this one:
Wow, gorgeous! But a quick perusal of my Facebook feed is enough to convince me that the possibility of such artful photography appearing on a regular basis is despairingly slim.</description>

      <description>This has been going around the internet. I have no idea who the source is, although they could ease up on the exclamation marks. It&amp;rsquo;s all spot on though - especially the part about playing Asteroids and Space Invaders. After the Atari 2600 came our first PC, running at 1 MHz and sporting a two-colour CGA monitor (orange and black). My brother and I begged and begged my Dad for a colour monitor and when that day finally came it blew our minds.</description>

      <description>Mark Zuckerberg famously quipped that &amp;ldquo;a squirrel dying in front of your house may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in Africa.&amp;rdquo; Except that this statement was no quip. Zuckerberg was quite serious - and it is precisely this blithe sentiment that underpins the real problem with Facebook. But when one becomes the world&amp;rsquo;s youngest billionaire you hardly identify with the proletariat anymore, do you? Heck, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t even fit in with the crusty 1 percent.</description>

      <description>Justin Freeman answers the question: What are the top 10 things that we should be informed about, in life?
1) Realize that nobody cares, and if they do, you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t care that they care. Got a new car? Nobody cares. You&amp;rsquo;ll get some gawkers for a couple of weeks—they don&amp;rsquo;t care. They&amp;rsquo;re curious. Three weeks in it&amp;rsquo;ll be just another shiny blob among all the thousands of others crawling down the freeway and sitting in garages and driveways up and down your street.</description>

      <description>I recently read a newsletter from a writer who flew off to this tropical paradise to relax and soak up some sun. She claimed that this getaway really helped her writing - whenever it rains (and in Vancouver, it does - a lot), she closes her eyes and remembers the warmth of the sun on her face. Energized, she then writes with new vigour.
Great idea, but what if you can&amp;rsquo;t afford it?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently reading the excellent book Speaker for the Dead by Orson Scott Card. In case you haven&amp;rsquo;t read it, the speaker investigates a deceased person&amp;rsquo;s life and then delivers a true account of the person - a sort of honest eulogy if you will - where the truth is told in place of polite praise, even if it hurts.
Anyway, this idea got me thinking about my grandfather. I remember the moment clearly.</description>

      <description>You have to destroy to re-build. So, once again, wordbit.com gets a makeover.
For a long time, wordbit.com pointed to my tumblr blog. But, I&amp;rsquo;ve since found that tumblr isn&amp;rsquo;t for me. Total respect for the platform and the people on it, but I found that longish text entries were passed over in favour of animated gifs and youtube videos. I do love these things, but I&amp;rsquo;m also a writer, and need a place to express myself outside of any constraint or cultural influence.</description>

      <description>This warning issued by the South African Police Department (SAPD) is quite chilling. And I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about the vexing combination of all caps and exclamation marks in the final plee of the second paragraph. Or the stilted language that includes all genders and age groups but excludes anyone not on their way to school or work. But, I digress.
Firstly, the crying child scenario is a sick reminder that criminals will use any means necessary to catch their prey.</description>

      <description>Taut naked limbs stretched but unlike saplings,
lacking musicality - more like organic hooks.
Poised over a midnight pool,
like a frozen breath nobody took.
Should I release this tension? Or will my supine ligaments snap,
tumbling me into the tepid waters where the drowned god waits
for a voice. Is it even a choice
I wonder to write of this -
to agonize over the spring.</description>

      <description>This is a guest post from Angela Giraud.
 So it is official! We have a toddling Frankenstein on our hands! She weighs 15 lbs and dwarfs most lap dogs and her name is the Monchkin! But instead of menacing stares, she is puttering around with rabid giggles, and in times of sheer determination some of the funniest monkey faces you are ever going to find. It is hard to hold back the rush of mommy euphoria in these moments and simply match her gleaming proud smile with my shrieks of laughter and praise!</description>

      <description>The world wants a piece of America. Not the real America mind you, with its ugly highways, guns, and inequalities, but fantasy America. US entertainment is a highly desirable commodity that is denied even to international netizens. Access to services like Netflix, Hulu, Pandora, and Spotify is stymied by an invisible Copyright wall where the wrong IP Address leaves you out in the cold.
Fortunately, there are ways to tunnel through that wall and get a piece of that US action.</description>

      <description>One thing writers like to do is teach others how to write well. There are several such instructive books that I highly recommend: Stephen King&amp;rsquo;s _On Writing_, Anne Lamott&amp;rsquo;s Bird by Bird, and William Zinsser&amp;rsquo;s classic On Writing Well.
Kurt Vonnegut, whose book I reviewed recently, also has some sound advice in this short piece. Here is a summary:

      <description>An old Cherokee is teaching his grandson about life. &amp;ldquo;A fight is going on inside me,&amp;rdquo; he said to the boy.
&amp;ldquo;It is a terrible fight and it is between two wolves. One is evil - he is anger, envy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority, and ego.&amp;rdquo;
He continued, &amp;ldquo;The other is good - he is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion, and faith.</description>

      <description>The New York Times recently reported that 91 percent of Americans aged 28-35 have used their mobile devices while on the toilet. Disturbingly, 20 percent of men and 13 percent of women have participated in a conference call from the john. Never before has the MUTE key played such an indispensable role.
Yet, while these statistics may leave you shaking your head in disgust (or not, if you&amp;rsquo;re sitting on the throne while you read this), some companies are taking the initiative.</description>

      <description>I was reading an interview with Limor Fried, the alpha-geek who founded the DIY electronics company Adafruit Industries, when I was struck by one of her answers:
 What kind of phone do you have?
I do not own a cell phone; however, I have designed a cell-phone jammer.
 Limor&amp;rsquo;s response was intriguing to me because of its dichotomy between technological know-how and an anti-technology stance. Here is an ubergeek who could reverse engineer a cellphone, yet who claims not to own one.</description>

      <description>I love Apple. Especially Apple hardware. And I&amp;rsquo;m glad they&amp;rsquo;re doing so well. But one area where they really messed up is in e-book pricing.
Steve Jobs wasn&amp;rsquo;t an avid reader. According to Isaacson&amp;rsquo;s biography, he just read the same Zen Buddhist book over and over. That kind of explains what happened. You may have heard the sordid tale, or read about it in the biography:
Amazon was first in the e-book market and established a wholesale model where no e-book sold for more than $9.</description>

      <description>Star Wars fan? Have a couple of hours to spare? Here&amp;rsquo;s an epic fan-made movie for you. Star Wars fans were each given 15 seconds of Star Wars IV: A New Hope. Contributors put their allotted scene together however they wanted without seeing each others. Then all the scenes were stitched together into the final product - a bizarre rendition of the entire Star Wars movie. Just like the classic drawing game Heads, Bodies, and Tails, hilarity ensues.</description>

      <description>I picked up this short book as a Kindle Daily Deal for a buck, so thought I&amp;rsquo;d give it a read.
Breakfast of Champions features Vonnegut&amp;rsquo;s alter-ego Kilgore Trout as he journeys to an arts festival. He is destined to meet a disillusioned car salesman. At the fateful meeting, Kilgore triggers a psychotic episode in which the salesman thinks everybody in the world is a robot, except for him.
This simple plot is a vehicle for Vonnegut&amp;rsquo;s typically biting satire, and for those who haven&amp;rsquo;t read Vonnegut yet, is an excellent primer for a trip into his twisted mind.</description>

      <description>Anyone who grew up in the 80s will remember Revenge of the Nerds. The movie made ruthless fun of nerds, while offering them an olive branch in the form of Hollywood catharsis. My, how times have changed.
Now, social awkwardness is endearing. Comic-book movies are cool. Gadgets, gaming, and tech are in. Kids want to be programmers and engineers. Their parents want them to do well in math and science - in short, they want their kids to be nerds.</description>

      <description>Last month, the Swedish government recognized The church of Kopimism as an official religion. The central tenet of this church is that the exchange of information is holy. The church has its own constitution, symbols, and even hymns. Worship consists of a digital service in which files are shared. Of course, to avoid litigious persecution, participants in &amp;ldquo;worship&amp;rdquo; must encrypt their traffic.
Now, you may have gotten sufficiently caught up in the recent SOPA and PIPA protests to think this is fantastic.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, Apple announced the arrival of interactive textbooks on it&amp;rsquo;s new iBooks2 platform, as well as an online course delivery system through iTunesU. Thus fulfilling Steve Jobs&amp;rsquo; dream to take on the textbook industry and relieve students everywhere of their back-breaking packs filled with dead trees.
A digital textbook seems like a great idea, but that&amp;rsquo;s where it ends - just a nice idea. The reality is that our educational landscape is so uneven and broken that the idea of iPads for every students seems a pipe dream at best.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s an interesting look at downtown Vancouver back in the days when cars were a rare sight. I believe the guy filming this was riding on one of those old trams:</description>

      <description>One of the coolest kinds of fictional tech has to be the transparent window, as seen in Minority Report, and by extension, the transparent tablet, à la Avatar. How long will it be before these futuristic interfaces become a reality? Not too long at all, it seems.
Science looks to science fiction when identifying an aesthetic that resonates with people. And it&amp;rsquo;s becoming apparent that the transparent touch user interface is the next big thing.</description>

      <title>Why every CEO should watch Kitchen Nightmares</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m quite enjoying Kitchen Nightmares (UK version) on Netflix. At first, I thought it was a typical cooking show, or merely a culinary car crash where Gordon Ramsay cuts down hapless cooks with his exceedingly foul mouth. And yes, there is a bit of that. But, surprisingly, Kitchen Nightmares is more a crash-course on effective business management.
It&amp;rsquo;s tough to make it as a restaurant owner, where most new restaurants fail in their first year.</description>

      <description>I came upon this recently - perhaps you&amp;rsquo;ve seen it in your neighbourhood? Nah, didn&amp;rsquo;t think so. This atrocious umbrella is a fantastic example of great engineering, but poor design. Terrible, insufferable design.
The Nubrella has a spec sheet that would make a meteorologist drool: aerodynamic, ergonomic, hands-free, and will never invert in a hurricane-force gale. But the trade-off is that you are transformed into a giant bobble head.
Nubrella, you can shower me with pictures of fashionable models sporting this monstrosity all you want but that will never impute a sense of style to your product.</description>

      <description>Cover from Whole Earth Catalog
This isn&amp;rsquo;t a book for fanboys who are looking for a insider&amp;rsquo;s view of Apple or the tech industry. The author, Walter Isaacson, is very much an outsider looking in. As such, he granted Steve Jobs a cool respect, but was never drawn in by Steve&amp;rsquo;s Reality Distortion Field.
As a result, this biography is extremely well researched. Isaacson gives us a measured, balanced narrative of Steve&amp;rsquo;s life.</description>

      <description>Netflix Canada&amp;rsquo;s strategy is to work the multicultural angle to make up for their poor selection of blockbuster hits. While they&amp;rsquo;re a bit short on the Hollywood, they&amp;rsquo;ve just loaded up on the Bollywood with about 60 new movies that&amp;rsquo;s sure to pique the interest of any fan of the genre. And with quirky titles like Mashaal, Dhoom, and Fraaandship, how can you go wrong?
My only niggle with this release is that they threw in a couple of Russel Peters shows in there too.</description>

      <description>Resolution #27: Sort through the 250 unread emails in my inbox.
That dreaded resolution sound familiar? How about taking it one step further and eliminating email altogether? A few weeks ago the IT firm Atos made waves when they revealed they were phasing out internal emails in favour of other networking tools. That got me thinking that email is dying a slow death for personal use as well.
Email was invented in 1972 and has had a good run, but it&amp;rsquo;s time to move on.</description>

      <title>Which kindle is the best?</title>

      <guid>https://wordbit.com/posts/which-kindle-is-the-best/</guid>
      <description>Answer: None of the above.
Back when the Kindle came out in 2007, it cost $400 and I didn&amp;rsquo;t think anyone would want one. But these days, a Kindle starts at $79 and is highly affordable. There are also more options to choose from.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve been buying e-books from Amazon, then you&amp;rsquo;re pretty much locked into their ecosystem. You may be wondering if it&amp;rsquo;s worth upgrading to one of the new kindles.</description>

      <description>Visitors to wordbit.com may be surprised to see that everything has changed. I decided it was time. The days of traditional personal blogging have long since waned for several reasons:
 The rise of social networking and micro-blogging.
 The tenacity of spammers who bypass all known spam-blocking plug-ins.
 The ghost town of most blogs that don&amp;rsquo;t have a cross-platform community.
 The dominance of corporate-run blogs where bloggers are paid to post something earth-shaking every hour.</description>

      <description>Well, I guess some old dude working in the mall gets a bit knackered after the 400th kid. At least he isn&amp;rsquo;t a mass murderer and tyrannical dictator of a communist country. Like Kim Jong-Il, spotted in a rare moment of charity as Santa, who is now dead.</description>

      <description>You may be wondering if I’m talking about the book or the HBO series. Well, I read the book first, so the TV show paled in comparison, as is usually the case. I was optimistic at first, mostly because of the glowing reviews and comparisons to Lord of the Rings. Peter Jackson undoubtedly won the hearts of purists and lovingly captured the spirit of the books. Unfortunately, the Game of Thrones TV series falls short of this benchmark.</description>

Personally, I’m a big fan of eneloop batteries. I believe the batteries Apple uses in their wireless mouse and keyboard are re-branded eneloops.</description>

      <description>In 1988 students from the University of Illinois were tasked with imagining the computer of the year 2000. What they came up with was a tablet computer that bears a striking resemblance to the iPad. From the report:
 Our machine will have the same dimensions as a standard notebook. It will look like an 8&amp;rdquo;x11&amp;rdquo; monolith from the movie 2001, and be reminiscent of the Dynabook. This rectangular slab will weigh but a few pounds, and have no buttons or knobs to play with.</description>

      <description>Netflix Canada has been busy releasing tons of new stuff, so I&amp;rsquo;ve given up detailing every single new release. Instead, here are my top picks based on movies I&amp;rsquo;ve either seen and recommend (especially flicks I consider to be &amp;ldquo;classic&amp;rdquo;), or movies I want to see because I&amp;rsquo;ve heard or read that they are good. These are based on the last few months of new releases.

      <description>Steve Jobs passed away yesterday. What is there to say about a visionary who changed the way we interact with our computers, communicate, listen to music, or even appreciate the beauty of typeface. There is so much to say that has been said more eloquently by others. I am greatly saddened, as are so many others, by the loss of such a powerhouse in the tech world.
Yet, although he has left us with many cool toys like iMacs, iPhones, and iPads, it is his inspiration which is a far greater legacy.</description>

      <description>So, yesterday the iPhone 4S was announced and the general sentiment was that it was a huge letdown. Even the media jumped on the bandwagon with news reports on CBC about how disappointing the whole deal was. Most sane observers will tell you the truth of it though: people get hung up on a name. An iPhone 4S sounds like a spec bump whereas an iPhone 5 sounds like a major upgrade, despite the fact that the new guts of the 4S are pretty impressive.</description>

      <description>On the Canada Day long weekend we went camping at Conkle Lake. It was a 450km drive, the last 25km on a dirt track in the middle of nowhere. We arrived at 10:30pm and discovered the campsite was pretty much full. Luckily for us though, we managed to snag the last spot! Unluckily, as I unpacked the tent, I realized that I had forgotten the tent poles at home. Fortunately, the park ranger lent us his tent and saved us from sleeping under the stars for three nights.</description>

      <description>The monchkin&amp;rsquo;s Nana and Grand-pere gave her the mobile you can see and hear in this video. She didn&amp;rsquo;t care about it at first, but these days she thinks it&amp;rsquo;s the best thing since second breakfast.

      <description>A smile from the monchkin is a rare sighting, but less so as the days go by. Her good-morning smile is the most exuberant, but she has a special smile reserved for the kind soul who changes her diaper as well.

      <description>Thanks to modern technology, Google street view now stretches just about everywhere. Even the lonely street in South Africa where I grew up in the 80s and 90s. Here is the house my dad built. It appears relatively unchanged. The only difference I can see is that the current occupants have removed the lopsided Christmas tree we used to have in the front yard. Over the years we lived there, my dad added a dining room and deck, servants quarters, and a swimming pool out back.</description>

      <description>Well, we didn&amp;rsquo;t win the Stanley Cup obviously. After losing to Boston in game 7, a riot broke out on the streets of Vancouver and erased any international goodwill generated by the Olympics last year. In a repeat of 1994, police were unprepared for the burning, looting and vandalizing that tarnished the city last night. But let me stress this fact: these idiots are not Vancouverites who live and work in the downtown core.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s not a lot to recommend in the latest releases. If you really want to watch a Thor movie, avoid this stinker and shell out the extra bucks for the excellent version that&amp;rsquo;s in the cinema right now. But if I had to pick, I&amp;rsquo;d go with the critic darling Waltz with Bashir, even though it looks like a bit of a downer.

      <description>My top pick for today is Noise. Not the highest rated movie, but Tim robbins and William Hurt are both fantastic actors and the plot of this indie flick looks intriguing. Of course, the proof is in the pudding, as I haven&amp;rsquo;t watched any of my top picks yet!
June 5 Noise Rotten Tomatoes Rating: 57%

Desperate for some peace and quiet, New York attorney David Owen (Tim Robbins) takes matters into his own hands.</description>

      <description>Good morning people. Here are the latest releases and ratings for Netflix Canada. My top pick today is 24 City. This looks like a very timely and relevant Chinese movie with a unique directing style and is our highest rated for today.
June 02 While She Was Out Rotten Tomatoes Rating: 33%

What starts out as a Christmas Eve trip to the mall ends up as an exercise in terror for suburban mom Della Myers (Kim Basinger) when she finds herself stranded in a forest and pursued by a quartet of thugs &amp;ndash; all because she&amp;rsquo;s left an angry note on their car.</description>

I bought the URL vancouverwriter.ca and put up something a little more modern. Just to be clear, I&amp;rsquo;m still happy in my present position at Vtech, but wanted to keep my html coding skills fresh, keep the portfolio up to date, and have a little fun to boot.

      <description>Much-loved Vancouver writer Derek Miller passed away yesterday at the age of 41. He had struggled with cancer for the past few years. I interviewed Derek for a Print Futures assignment a while back and wrote an article about his writing career. In the interview, Derek told me that he didn&amp;rsquo;t know what the future would hold, but he knew for sure he would still be writing. He was right.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been running three days a week for about two years now. Last year I took the Sun Run more seriously and got a record time:
This year I only shaved 29 seconds off last year&amp;rsquo;s time:
If I want to improve next year, then some serious training is in order. Then again, perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s time to retire as I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to keep my number 2 spot in the company. For 2012, I may just do the 2KM walk with BabGi in the stroller.</description>

There is much heated debate surrounding this issue and I got a lot of hate mail for even suggesting we don’t know all there is to know about the technology. The hard truth is that we just don’t have the data spanning a human lifetime to say one way or the other, so lay off haters!</description>

      <description>Here are the photos from our Maternity photoshoot. The photographer&amp;rsquo;s name is Natalia Ignatova and she was terrific. I have a feeling we won&amp;rsquo;t be able to afford her in a few years. I know most guys go misty-eyed at the prospect of taking their shirts off and hugging the baby belly - but it&amp;rsquo;s worth doing (if only to make the wife happy). Anyway, these turned out really great.</description>

      <description>Warning: this is not a movie for angry nerds. If you ponder over the concepts of multiple dimensions and consciousness and that sort of esoteric stuff more deeply, the purist in you will start to bristle. And don&amp;rsquo;t even start to go down the road of analyzing why a movie called Source Code has nothing to do with late nights coding in C+ at your Linux box. That said, this movie is such a wild romp through quasi-temporal what-ifs that you&amp;rsquo;ll soon forget these half-baked concepts.</description>

On Sunday, we attended the Vancouver International Auto show. It was in the new convention centre this time around. Overall, I thought the show was well put together, but not quite as good as last year&amp;rsquo;s. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why. Perhaps the novelty has worn off or perhaps there were just too many people this time and the layout was a wee bit crowded.</description>

      <description>My wife really wanted this Phil and Ted&amp;rsquo;s Explorer stroller. We checked out Babies R Us, but as expected, the customer service was poor. No disrespect to all those hard-working retail people - I was one of them once - but this lady did not know anything about the product. They were charging about $540 for it. Yeah, I know, you could buy a second-hand car for that price. But, apparently, and I say apparently because the amount of research I&amp;rsquo;ve done palls in comparison with my wife&amp;rsquo;s diligent on-line sleuthing, this stroller is a sound investment.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a little late to the party, but I finished reading this Swedish crime thriller last night. It&amp;rsquo;s been on the best seller lists for a while and thought I would give it a go. The story centres on a downtrodden journalist, Mikael Blomkvist as he investigates the mysterious disappearance of a girl who went missing 40 years earlier. He gets some help from the gothic, autistic, troubled, grown up Pippi Longstocking character, Lisbeth Salander.</description>

      <description>Serenity is undoubtedly a movie for the fans. After Firefly&amp;rsquo;s abrupt end, the absence of any kind of denouement left a gaping hole in the fabric of this fictional universe, and left the fans howling for more. This movie does fill that hole somewhat, but not completely. Answers to nagging questions still linger&amp;hellip; Who were the mysterious blue-gloved men? Do Captain Reynolds and Inara ever get together? Who was the Shepherd really?</description>

      <description>There was some good news on the Netflix front yesterday as the company announced a deal with Paramount Studios. This brings some serious cool to the Canadian version of Netflix, which has a astonishingly meagre library compared its big brother in the States. We now have Iron Man 2 - and the USA doesn&amp;rsquo;t - I mean, how awesome is that. But just when you thought the awesomeness was over, Netflix delivered another boon to Canadians:</description>

      <description>I recently finished watching the complete Firefly series on Netflix. That sounds like a lot of TV watching, but it only ran for 14 episodes before it got cancelled due to low ratings. Most geeks agree, however, that this show was a little gem, was poorly marketed by Fox, and should never have died so early. After watching it, I would have to agree.
I guess this show falls into the space-western genre, and with plenty of horses, bandits, prostitutes, and bounty hunters, I&amp;rsquo;d say it falls more into the &amp;ldquo;western&amp;rdquo; part of the spectrum.</description>

      <description>This is a real job posting. I appreciate the brute honesty because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound like a job I&amp;rsquo;d be that interested in. But some sicko might be. And yes, they actually are looking for a &amp;ldquo;sicko&amp;rdquo;:
 We want to add some talent to the Sarasota Herald-Tribune investigative team. Every serious candidate should have a proven track record of conceiving, reporting and writing stellar investigative pieces that provoke change. However, our ideal candidate has also cursed out an editor, had spokespeople hang up on them in anger and threatened to resign at least once because some fool wanted to screw around with their perfect lede.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve checked out What To Expect When You&amp;rsquo;re Expecting, and it&amp;rsquo;s ok, albeit a little on the alarmist side. But it turns out, one of the most straightforward and well laid out books is the one published by Health Canada. Unfortunately, they stopped sending new parents the hard copy, but you can download the PDF here. This book also includes lots of illustrations of useful positions for when mom goes into labour.</description>

      <description>I pretty much use Firefox exclusively, especially on a windows machine. The one-two punch of the NoScript and Adblock extensions definitely curbs viruses and spyware. So far, I&amp;rsquo;m liking the new version - the interface is pretty slick, but I&amp;rsquo;m not seeing massive speed gains. It&amp;rsquo;s certainly not 6x faster as claimed. But, shiny new releases are always good.</description>

      <description>The Daily Mail newspaper in the U.K. has published a great article on Jonathan Ive (although the newspaper itself is poorly edited, so take it with a pinch of salt). The article provides some interesting insights into Ive&amp;rsquo;s design process. For instance, Ives has spent time with Japan&amp;rsquo;s secretive Samurai sword forgers to learn how they push metallurgy to the edge. Another example of his fastidiousness is that he spent months obsessing over the iMac stand so that its aesthetics would convey the balance and curves of a sunflower stalk.</description>

      <description>My poor wife hasn&amp;rsquo;t had much luck lately. First she was robbed by an incorrigible scoundrel in church, who as I mentioned, will probably burn in hell. Then, yesterday, she caught a stomach bug and couldn&amp;rsquo;t keep anything down. So for about 4 hours last night we were at the hospital. Baby&amp;rsquo;s heartbeat was really high because my wife was dehydrated. So, they hooked up an IV to her and gave her some fluids intravenously.</description>

      <title>Exit interviews for Catholics the answer to declining attendance?</title>

      <description>Interesting idea. However, a qualitative approach like this one will do little to change the traditions of the church. The Catholic church moves at a glacial pace and will not change to meet the needs of an increasingly disenchanted populace.
Besides, if the questionnaire is tailored to individual parishes only, then systemic, global trends cannot be identified. Also, in my experience, the church cares little for the sacrilegious opinions of those that leave the flock.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, my wife went to church and was helping out on coffee duty. She had left her purse unattended for a few minutes and some low-life cowardly thief took off with it. She lost her wallet with credit cards, bank cards, driver&amp;rsquo;s licence, car keys, house keys, and new cell phone I had given her for a Christmas present. We cancelled the credit and debit cards immediately.
What sucks is that we had to change the locks on our apartment, which cost $200 because it was a Sunday.</description>

      <description>We recently went on one of those all-inclusive vacations to Puerto Aventuras, Mexico (South of Cancun on the Mayan Riviera). It was out first time doing the all-inclusive thing, but we were suitably impressed. The weather was fantastic and the food was great. The only bad thing that happened was that I lost half my tooth when I bit into a seed in a fruit of foreign extraction. I didn&amp;rsquo;t let it stop me though and just chewed on the right side of my mouth.</description>

I have dual 19-inch monitors, which is nice. I have windows XP installed. But what I really love is the new computer I have at home. It was a birthday/Christmas gift.

      <description>Here are some Ultra-sound pictures of baby Giraud! These range from 10 weeks at 3cm all the way to 30 weeks. At this point we don&amp;rsquo;t know if baby is a boy or girl. Nor do we have a name. Yikes! But at least I painted his/her room this weekend. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice manly/feminine turquoise colour.

      <description>Another year is upon us and wordbit is in its 5th year! But with sporadic posts, this site has slowly slipped into oblivion. Well, I always have good intentions, but I have decided to create another personal blog, while keeping wordbit as the &amp;ldquo;public face&amp;rdquo; of my professional life. So, my personal blog is at antoineg.info, but you&amp;rsquo;ll need to ask me for the password to access it. If I know you, you&amp;rsquo;re in!</description>

      <description>Well, it was a tough decision, but I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to make this blog an opt-in, closed area only. Visitors will have to know the password, which they can only get from me. I think this will be a neat way to share pictures of vacations, and the baby, etc. without exposing it to the general public, spammers, and anonymous creeps while still owning my information, unlike facebook.</description>

      <description>I think I&amp;rsquo;ll give Posterous a try. Seems like an easy way to blog from anywhere. Who knows, I may actually keep this going if it goes well. Microblogging seems the way to go these days. I checked out Tumblr, but I&amp;rsquo;m liking Posterous better so far. Of course, I still have my regular blog on wordbit.com, but Wordpress is not as easy to update on the fly. Besides, I really need something more personal.</description>

      <description>Seems like an oxymoron, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it. Hasn&amp;rsquo;t everybody read Harry Potter? Does anybody who goes to a Harry Potter not know what&amp;rsquo;s going to happen the minute Potter raises his wand? Sadly, yes. For every thousand kids that read the book, there are probably tens of thousands more that find the Potter movies as fresh and entertaining as the Lord of the Rings, precisely because they never even read the books.</description>

Well I’m not one of those nitpicking technocrats. I think that the iPad is like a shiny piece of the future, straight out of Star Trek. It’s amazing. But here’s the thing: I don’t even own a laptop.</description>

      <description>So, you&amp;rsquo;ve done all your Christmas shopping, and maybe scored a few deals by reading my last blog post. Now you want to have some fun in the snow but the rocky economic climate is scaring you off the slopes. Continuing on the theme of thrifty spending, check out my latest article on finding deals on winter sports equipment (while being eco-savvy at the same time).
I enjoyed writing this article because, well, I&amp;rsquo;m a SME when it comes to being cheap.</description>

      <description>So the economy is caught in a perpetual flush cycle and the government is crumbling under the pressure of imminent deficits. You&amp;rsquo;re waiting for HR to ask you to stop by so they can talk about &amp;ldquo;restructuring&amp;rdquo;. You&amp;rsquo;re wondering if you can even afford to drive to the mall this holiday season, let alone buy mounds of stuff there. Well, no worries. Here are some resources for thrifty Canadians with the most meagre of budgets, because let&amp;rsquo;s face it - right now it&amp;rsquo;s cool to be cheap.</description>

      <description>Not all of Apple&amp;rsquo;s offerings are shiny and perfect. And when it comes to iTunes, most sane people will agree that this music player is just plain ugly. I applaud Scott Gilberson for calling it like it is in his blog post, &amp;ldquo;The Top Ten Reasons iTunes Sucks&amp;rdquo;. Here are his main beefs:
 It&amp;rsquo;s a store stupid
 The library manager is prehistoric
 No web browser/Wikipedia/anything
 No plug-in architecture</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re more concerned with your company culture than the size of your pay cheque, your might be interested in this Vancouver start-up. Jiibe is a user-generated service that matches your value system to a compatible company based on a questionnaire you fill out.
I can see this site being really useful to young Millennials who care a great deal about the softer aspects of job satisfaction and are in a process of self-discovery.</description>

      <description>That&amp;rsquo;s probably the cheesiest line I&amp;rsquo;ve ever written. But for some reason, the editors over at alive actually seem to revel in cheese (One example is the title I&amp;rsquo;ll eternally shake my head at: G&amp;hellip;I can&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s a Glycemic index). God bless &amp;lsquo;em though - they&amp;rsquo;re a wonderful bunch.
Anyway, here&amp;rsquo;s an article I really enjoyed writing because, well, I love surfing! And so does Scott over in the art department.</description>

      <description>Here are some recent article shorts. As usual, you can click on the thumbnails to read them. The one on the left is a feel-good piece on laughter yoga. The right piece touches on the depressing psychological and cultural effects of global warming. There&amp;rsquo;s also a teeny one in there on the dodgy air we have to breathe in airplanes (even Purell won&amp;rsquo;t save you this time).
 
Seeing these two articles juxtaposed like this evokes a stark contrast between Western frivolity and Aboriginal reality.</description>

      <description>As you may or may not recall, last August my article on the evils of recycling was published. Sometimes I lose sight of the fact that thousands of people read the stuff I put out there. Some probably think it&amp;rsquo;s a load of tosh. Other slightly more creepy individuals google my name and usually ask some sort of favour. But others actually have something interesting to say. So Ben, even though you&amp;rsquo;ll never read this, thanks for your letter.</description>

      <description>I say eleven, because Ben Minson came up with this excellent list of seven plus four more on his blog, Gryphon Mountain. His list gives reasons why a company should hire a technical writer. Check it out if you need to justify your existence or if nobody has fought through the cobwebs to your cubicle in a while and you suspect the engineering department has forgotten about you. Or maybe you need to explain what-it-is-you-do-exactly in a job interview.</description>

      <description>Wired magazine has some interesting pieces this month. Well, every month is pretty good, but writers might appreciate this behind-the-scenes look at how an article is assigned, written, edited, and designed. You can read the email correspondence between author and editor, and get an idea of how to pitch your story idea to a magazine. Great stuff.
Also, technical writers might get a kick out of this photo essay of classic instruction manuals.</description>

If you signed up on September 30th, your right to slam a deviant telemarketer will kick in this October 30th. Sweet. When will companies learn that people telemarketing is the second most hated form of privacy invasion on this planet (Door-to-door marketing holds the number one spot in my mind)? Even junk mail doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem as bad, as annoying as it is.</description>

      <description>In this rocky economic climate, marketing yourself has never been more crucial if you want to survive the inevitable cutbacks. When it comes to technical writing, it&amp;rsquo;s a useful exercise to understand and appreciate what companies look for in a writer.

It&amp;rsquo;s a short piece but the artwork is nicely laid out in a groovy &amp;lsquo;70s inspired way. Good job art department!

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been about four months since my classmates and I graduated from the Print Futures Professional Writing Program. If you&amp;rsquo;re serious about your craft and are thinking of attending this two-year diploma program, I heartily encourage you to go for it. I love to write and I love getting paid to do it even more. But don&amp;rsquo;t kid yourself - writing well works up a mental sweat for every writer, whether oozing with talent or not.</description>

      <description>I thought it was high time for an update on the first two weeks of my contract. As I alluded to previously, the project I&amp;rsquo;m working on right now involves the design of a new phone. It&amp;rsquo;s a complex system with many components, and is rather hush-hush at the moment so I can&amp;rsquo;t really elaborate on it. Thus far, much of the system behaviour has been decided upon verbally, which is where I come in.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just signed a 6-month contract with Vtech to work as a technical writer in their engineering department! As you probably know, Vtech primarily designs and manufactures cordless phones as well as other wireless devices.
The company usually outsources their documentation to the States. Presently, however, they&amp;rsquo;re developing a completely new product line (sorry, I can&amp;rsquo;t say what it is) and need a writer in-house. This is a new position, so the challenge for me will be in ensuring that I get the information I need from the engineers without taking too much time away from their primary tasks.</description>

      <description>The auto industry may have killed the electric car a few years ago, but it&amp;rsquo;s back - and dude, this is one sweet ride. Yes, going green has never been so self-indulgent&amp;hellip;or pricey for that matter. The Tesla Roadster is a 100% electric and is available in the US and Europe, but you have to reserve it. All 2008 models are sold and in production, but you can snag a 2009 model for a mere $109,000.</description>

      <description>Is it worth switching carriers for? It certainly is tempting. Sweet 3G, the 2.0 software update and a price tag of (only) $199 on a three-year contract. Both Fido and Rogers will be launching the device on July 11 - but I happen to be with Telus. If I had a lame plan I&amp;rsquo;d drop Telus in a nanosecond. The problem is, I&amp;rsquo;m getting a pretty good deal right now - a carry-over from the time when you got unlimited evenings and weekends by default.</description>

 &amp;ldquo;But how?&amp;rdquo; my students ask. &amp;ldquo;How do you actually do it?&amp;rdquo;
You sit down, I say. You try to sit down at approximately the same time every day. This is how you train your unconscious to kick in for you creatively.</description>

Also, I&amp;rsquo;ve recently updated my ePortfolio, which I&amp;rsquo;m going to recommend to all potential employers from now on. I&amp;rsquo;ve been sending out links to the portfolio on this blog, but that page is becoming a bit unwieldy.</description>

      <description>Today I attended a pre-conference workshop on Simplified Technical English (STE) at DocTrain West. Berry Braster, director of Tedopres, presented the benefits of writing documentation using standardized, unambiguous English, especially when materials are being translated into other languages.
The implementation of STE involves developing a company-specific dictionary and using documentation software to aid in the mechanical side of ensuring uniformity of language across the board. The goal is to ultimately reduce costs and facilitate quality assurance.</description>

What does splashing out on some smoking wheels have to do with livability?). Vancouver shuffled in at number 10.

 Faster (better memory management). Two to four times faster than Firefox 2.
 Safer. Scans for malware and checks for phishing.
 More intuitive address bar (with autofill feature).</description>

      <description>Every profession needs a theme song, right? Here&amp;rsquo;s one I found about technical writing, unashamedly cannibalized from the Beatles song &amp;ldquo;Paperback Writer.&amp;rdquo;

This little ditty isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly inspiring with lyrics like these: &amp;ldquo;So I spend my day inside a lonely pod, but I need a job, so I gotta be a technical writer.&amp;rdquo; But hey, it&amp;rsquo;s worth a laugh anyway.</description>

      <title>Find a tech-writing job in Vancouver - Part 2</title>
      <link>https://wordbit.com/posts/find-a-tech-writing-job-in-vancouver-part-2/</link>

      <description>I mentioned in part one of this series that 80% of jobs can only be found in that elusive place called &amp;ldquo;the hidden job market.&amp;rdquo; About 20% of those gigs can be gotten through employment services, cold calling, and other tactics, such as information interviews. But the other 60% are landed through referrals. That makes networking your only way to access a big chunk of the job market.
So how do you rustle up some contacts in Vancouver, a city that has a reputation for being a tad on the chilly side?</description>

      <description>For those of you who aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar with it, Brijit is a website that publishes 100-word summaries of various web, TV, radio, and print media. The idea is that there is so much information out there - wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be nice if we had the short-short version so we can get the gist of it and decide if it&amp;rsquo;s worth reading or watching the whole thing.
It&amp;rsquo;s a neat idea, but with so much content out there, it would be impossible for an editorial team to cover it all.</description>

      <description>Have you ever had a job that bored you into zombie mode faster than Seabiscuit on steroids? According to this BBC article, scientists have developed a headset that measures when our brains are about to switch into autopilot mode. This state of cognitive rest is the brain&amp;rsquo;s way of saving cogitations for something more mentally taxing like what to make for dinner tonight.
Going brain dead is all very well if you&amp;rsquo;re gluing hula skirts onto tiki dolls on an assembly line, but what about if you&amp;rsquo;re, say, an air traffic controller?</description>

This website uses some flash elements and some fancy css coding and is basically geared towards technical writing employers as a way to showcase my work. I may expand it in the future to include other samples too.
For those who are interested, I designed it in Dreamweaver, Illustrator, and Photoshop. I used FlashSpring Pro 2 to convert a Powerpoint to flash.</description>

      <description>The content convergence and integration conference was a mind-blowing excursion into the wild terrains of content management. For those confused by the conference title, let me tell you the gist of it (from what I could gather).
We live in the information age, yet for the most part organizations fail to use content as a commodity and a valuable asset. As writers, we need to impress upon decision makers that the strategic use of content can indeed achieve the goals of the company, and is not a superfluous add-on.</description>

Each day has a specific theme. Day 1 (today) is about content, day 2 about technology, and day 3 about user relationships. I&amp;rsquo;ll be volunteering there the whole day tomorrow, and will tell you all about it later (if you&amp;rsquo;re going, be sure to say hello).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m going to start a series on finding a tech-writing job specifically in the high-tech hub of Vancouver, BC (which is where I happen to live). As I started the job search process myself, I noticed a dearth of information on this topic. I hope I can dig up some useful info for those in a similar position - eventually I&amp;rsquo;ll port this stuff over to my resources page.
So, without further ado, here is part 1, which will focus on job search engines.</description>

      <description>The cultural differences in the perception of colour are well known to anthropologists. Red, for example is bold and signifies anger in the West, but is considered lucky in the East, especially in China. But do web designers take the cultural colour faux pas into consideration? They should. Especially if designing for international clients. After all, colour is a tricky beast and just because you happen to be in love with mauve, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean your client will.</description>

My story, The Reluctant Teacher, was published in it this year. I&amp;rsquo;ve had some poetry published in Pearls before, but that was about 8 years ago, so it&amp;rsquo;s been a while. A few of the authors read by candlelight and I got to see a few familiar faces.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m glad I was able to attend Northern Voice this year - it was informative and inspiring for the most part. All the clicking laptops around me were a bit daunting, but gave me something to aspire to.
The morning kicked off with the keynote address by Matt Mullenweg, founder of Wordpress (the excellent blogging platform on which this website is based). Listen to the audio here.
I then listened to a talk by the CEO of Broadband Mechanics, Marc Canter on bringing social to software.</description>

      <description>It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter how many firewalls, P2P filters, script blockers, or spyware removers you use, the one giveaway to your identity on the Internet is your IP address. Those numbers will trumpet your location to whoever&amp;rsquo;s interested, which is why you&amp;rsquo;ll often see annoying ads like &amp;ldquo;Find friends in (insert your city here) now!&amp;rdquo; This lack of privacy is a huge problem for political dissidents in China, or for anyone in that country who wants to surf an uncensored version of the net.</description>

      <description>Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a hardcore blogger or just thinking of starting one up, you can&amp;rsquo;t miss Northern Voice, Vancouver&amp;rsquo;s 4th blogging and social media conference. This event gets bigger and more popular every year, but is still &amp;ldquo;cheap, friendly and open to all.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s only $40 for one day ($60 for both).
On a similar note, the second DocTrain West is coming to Vancouver in May and the topic is - gosh, what a shocker - Web 2.</description>

      <description>Jakob Nielson is a web usability consultant who believes that page loading times should determine how a website is designed. To improve the user experience, for example, he advocates against using large graphics or fancy flash animations (among other things) because most users don&amp;rsquo;t have broadband. His work is important because it focuses on the most efficient way for users to navigate the web and websites. Partly as a result of his teachings, website designers have moved away from bloated graphic-heavy websites to cleaner, more intuitive interfaces.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking around for a book review website that aggregates all the critic reviews, sort of like Rotten tomatoes does with movies. The best I could find was the website for Bookmarks Magazine. They add up reviews from most major US newspapers to give a book a rating out of five stars. It&amp;rsquo;s a handy way to see if a book will make it past your discerning taste radar and sneak its way onto your bedside table.</description>

Well, they&amp;rsquo;re an international consortium made up of member organizations who work together with the public to develop web standards. They want to make sure the web does not become fragmented by incompatible technologies and vested interests. To this end, they keep everything open source. They&amp;rsquo;re also involved in education and outreach and see themselves as a forum for open discussion about the web.</description>

      <description>Apple&amp;rsquo;s new MacBook Air is purportedly the world&amp;rsquo;s thinnest (and sexiest) laptop, but is a bit shallow when it comes to hardware. The lack of CD-Rom drive or landline internet access for example, may discourage first-time laptop buyers. But if you need some compelling reasons to shell out for a laptop you can fit into a manilla envelope, perhaps these philanthropic possibilities will persuade you:

The new design isn&amp;rsquo;t bad, but then again, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a problem with the old one either. I guess they were trying to go with a more community-based, web 2.0 format. The layout is still a bit cluttered, but looks lighter.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re a wannabe iPod disciple and the rumour of an iPod levy had you on your knees praying for an intervention, your prayers have been answered. Canada&amp;rsquo;s federal court told the Canadian Copyright Board they had &amp;ldquo;no authority&amp;rdquo; to impose the levy, according to this CBC News article.
Well, this is good news indeed. I already find it cheaper to buy blank CDs in the States and would hate to cross the border to buy electronic goods as well.</description>

      <description>Over at Wired&amp;rsquo;s video gallery you can watch some amusing tech vintage commercials. While I find the ones for the old Mac, the Vic-20, and the Commodore chuckle worthy, my vote for the funniest - and the most creative - goes to the 1980s ad for the Atari 5200&amp;rsquo;s Pole Position. Back in those days, the marketing strategy was basically to show as little of the game&amp;rsquo;s graphics as possible while hyping up the game in various ridiculous ways.</description>

      <description>This story is a few months old, but it just came to my attention and I thought it was really neat. Scientists at MIT have successfully transmitted electricity through the air. In an experiment, they were able to successfully power a 60 watt light bulb from a power source two metres away. The team are calling this new concept &amp;ldquo;witricity&amp;rdquo;.
The potential for this new technology is pretty exciting. Imagine a world where laptops and cellphones could power themselves up when the batteries get low.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve seen Vista in action and it looks slick, but it seems to be all flash at this point. I&amp;rsquo;m extremely satisfied with the robustness of Windows Server 2003, which is so rock solid because it was designed to administer networks.</description>

      <description>You may be aware of Canada&amp;rsquo;s Private Copyright Collective, the organization responsible for the ridiculous levy on blank audio cassettes and CDs. Now this collective is lobbying hard for a levy on recording devices such as MP3 players, cellphones, computers, and anything you can record with basically. Their argument is that just because you can pirate music on these devices, you should pay for it. These extortionist royalties are distributed to eligible songwriters, musicians, and record production companies (although the collective is unclear on who exactly is eligible - they don&amp;rsquo;t even have to be Canadian).</description>

First of all, I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing for the print edition of alive at a readership of about 500,000. Then every Tuesday articles I&amp;rsquo;ve edited for Metro Canada comes out countrywide at a readership of 700,000. And the tips of the day I write for Living Naturally are published on at least 7000 websites in the US and Canada, according to this Google search.</description>

      <description>Amazon took a stab at revolutionizing the reading world today with the launch of its new wireless reading device called the Kindle. It&amp;rsquo;s about the size of a paperback, has a built in keyboard and a display that&amp;rsquo;s easy on the eyes and visible in sunlight. To buy a book you hook into their network through a wireless connection, but it&amp;rsquo;s more like making a call on your cell because you don&amp;rsquo;t have to find a hotspot.</description>

      <description>CNET just released its readers top choices for sparkly new toys they want under the tree this year. Not surprisingly the Apple iphone is only in the number five spot, despite the price slash. As for the number one spot, well, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I agree with that one.

      <description>The Writer&amp;rsquo;s Guild of America are striking, but do you know why? Check out this three-minute video clip for an explanation. Or you could just watch more re-runs and hope that your favourite show will come back&amp;hellip;eventually.

Electronic rights for authors seems a fair deal, but lets be honest - These guys are making a lot more money than writers outside of the film industry. I wonder if editors have ever gone on strike?</description>

      <description>In a congressional hearing held on Tuesday November 6 as part of a lawsuit against Yahoo, CEO Jerry Yang and vice-president Michael Callahan were chastised for their involvement in the arrest and imprisonment of a Chinese journalist. Yahoo is currently on trial for aiding and abetting in the torture of Chinese dissidents.
In 2005, Chinese journalist Shi Tao was convicted by his government for divulging “state secrets”. Shi Tao had forwarded an email from the Communist Party warning the media not to observe the 15th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre in 2004.</description>

He advises us to model ourselves after Leonardo da Vinci, who believed that seven key elements allowed him to become one of the most incredible innovators of our time. Here they are:

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m administering a new podcast for Rev. Craig Vance at my church. Craig&amp;rsquo;s sermons are really insightful and quite intellectual. Anyway, the technical side of things has hardly been cutting edge as I&amp;rsquo;ve been recording onto cassette tapes that get chewed up in my 1990 cassette player before they even get turned into an MP3. Nevertheless, I&amp;rsquo;ve managed two so far and plan to keep that site updated every week. Check it out if you&amp;rsquo;re interested.</description>

      <description>Some of you may know that Vancouver is hosting the 2010 Olympic Games and that the Vancouver Olympic Organizing Committee (VANOC) has been under fire for booting the impoverished out of the downtown eastside to make the streets pretty for the impending tourist influx. You may also have heard of anti-poverty activist David Cunningham, who threatened to symbolically evict all the board members of VANOC from their plush homes by camping on their lawn and performing some kind of ritual.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve heard tales of proofreaders being unappreciated and underpaid, but this takes the cake! Check out this news article on a proofreader who died at work and was only discovered five days later by the janitor.
Okay, okay, this story seems too bizarre to be true, and so it is. This article was later determined to be a fake. I mean think about it - even if the office had it&amp;rsquo;s air conditioning turned up to the max (unlikely on a cold October day in New York), the corpse would have started emitting an offense odour after three days.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m assuming you cannot read Japanese, so the challenge before you is to decipher what this product is based on the images alone. Can you figure out just what this newfangled USB device does? A little research might help you out!</description>

      <description>Can governments read people&amp;rsquo;s minds with radio waves? Many people believe so. In fact, in order to combat this unseen menace, a paranoid subculture has arisen around the wearing of tin foil hats. This seemingly bizarre practice has garnered such credibility that an MIT student conducted empirical research in order to debunk it. Curiously, his findings indicated that tin foil in fact amplifies certain radio frequencies. Ironically, or perhaps tellingly, the frequencies amplified are the very same governmental and corporate frequencies that paranoids are trying to avoid.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy writing and editing full-time at alive, and loving it! I especially enjoy interacting with readers of the magazine and answering their questions and concerns in that nice, friendly manner that sometimes straddles the line between professionalism and condescension. I&amp;rsquo;d love to write about it in more detail here, but there are confidentiality issues involved, suffice to say, I do get a lot of &amp;lsquo;interesting&amp;rsquo; letters from those that perhaps do not have full reign over their mental faculties.</description>

Unfortunately, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing like the tantalizing lure of speed and power to blind even the most cautious of web surfers, especially if your Internet connection is agonizingly sluggish.
It&amp;rsquo;s not surprising then, that this tubetorial on speeding up the Internet with Firefox caught my attention. I did briefly try it out before turning it off in horror.</description>

Call it what you will - jargoneze, legalize, bureaucrateze, or just plain gobbledygook. If you&amp;rsquo;re spreading this kind of rot, you&amp;rsquo;re a language killer and should be tried and condemned by your peers as such. In his essay, _Politics and the English Language_, the great George Orwell calls us to vigilance:</description>

      <description>Wordbit has been down for the count for a few days due to an experimental Google app I unwisely installed. So, just in case you were thinking of trying out one of the apps in Google Labs, think again.
Google Accelerator ostensibly speeds up your Internet browsing by diverting web pages through their servers. The problem is that the program pre-fetches all websites on any given page. This is fine for public browsing at, say, a library.</description>

 How do you pronounce an initialism like HTML?
I was taught English in public Australian schools of the 1970s. So I was taught aitch rather than haitch. Which means I pronounce ‘HTML’ with an initial vowel sound and I write ‘an HTML page.</description>

      <description>There is no denying that the iPod has become part of our popular culture. What started as a neat toy for Mac users blossomed into a fashion craze for young urban hipsters. These cool urbanites identified each other not with secret handshakes but by the white ear-buds that had become the icon for &amp;ldquo;coolness&amp;rdquo;. The rise of the iPod sub-culture has a grassroots foundation in the heart of the thriving metropolis - on gritty city streets, on crowded subway trains and in public places.</description>

Well, with the exception of some Asian cultures (In Asia the exchange of business cards is ritualistic - The reciever takes the card respectfully with two hands and studies it carefully before placing it carefully into a pocket for safekeeping).
Your business card is a little piece of you that somebody carries around in their wallet.</description>

I haven’t launched a full-scale marketing campaign yet, so I’m inviting whatever phantom readers I have here to check it out and comment on it. Now, it’s not entirely done yet, but feedback would be great.
Here are some great reasons to switch to wordbit.com:

Wordbits are the building blocks of language. This website is my small attempt to bring meaning to what we do as writers and hopefully contribute something to the writing &amp;ldquo;blogosphere&amp;rdquo;, if you&amp;rsquo;ll excuse the jargon.
But this website is more than a blog. This is also a place where you can view my on-line portfolio, or check out some resources for other writers (still in progress).</description>

Unfortunately, the slide show only shows the first fifty shots from each album, but click-through on the link below the slide-show if for some reason you want to see them all. And why wouldn’t you? They’re really really good.</description>

      <description>A bit of a mixed bag today.
Firstly, I am proud to announce that I am the new godfather for a young lad in England who was recently born to some wonderful parents, one of whom is my best friend from high school. Perhaps when he is old enough I can communicate with him via webcam and impart my wisdom to another little being who will probably know more about computers than I ever will.</description>

      <description>I found these crazy pictures of extreme army training in North Korea on Thrilling Wonder. Go there to check out some insane anti-US propaganda posters too.
Nothing like rubbing snow all over your half-naked body to get you ready to kill some Americans.
If these guys ever invaded the Yukon, we’d be screwed.
BTW, I should be online again soon.

      <description>Dear reader,
Perhaps you are wondering why updates have been frustratingly infrequent of late at Wordspace. I share your frustration. I have been without internet at home now for about a month due to…well, you wouldn’t believe it if I told you. Anyway, let me assure you that I am working on getting it back and when I do, I can once again parlay my procrastination into fruitful blogging.
Regards, Antoine</description>

      <description>I was looking around for the perfect domain name last night and I found it. I’m not going to say what it was because it was just too good. So, I rubbed my hands in glee, took out my credit card and bought it at godaddy. Then I get an email telling me that somebody else owns the name. According to the WHOis database, somebody purchased the name about a minute before I did, but I still got charged for it.</description>

      <description>My girlfriend was telling me about her Bikram yoga class today and how you pay $20 a class to just sit there like a pretzel and sweat and feel nauseous and have acid bile rise up your throat at each contortion. Wow, what fun. Anyway, apparently all the other ladies at yoga sport Lululemon outfits. This was the first time I’d been introduced to this apparently wildly popular brand.
Needless to say, inspired by the “yes men” video, I looked into the company and was pleased to see they were based in Vancouver and produced all their clothes here.</description>

      <description>I while back I got fined for parking at work. Yes, at work. The injustice of the situation hardened my resolve to never pay this fine. After a few softcore letters I received this hardcore final notice, which I kept because it is a fine example of Aristotelian logos, pathos and ethos being used to full effect.
After reading it, I was almost persuaded to pay the fine because I thought I was being sued - at first.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t really post in here as often as in wordspace, and when I do the entries are mostly duplicated. To be honest, I&amp;rsquo;m having a little trouble posting pictures and videos in this journal, but I&amp;rsquo;d like to keep it alive. So, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to post updates periodically, but you&amp;rsquo;re going to have to go to wordspace to read the actual entry. Sorry about that. If the entry is text only, chances are you can find it here too.</description>

      <description>I had to share these two awesome pieces of media, even though I’m technically supposed to be stoically hacking away at my 500 page burden. First of all, Wade Davis, the popular anthropologist, spoke recently at U.B.C. Do yourself a huge favour and take a listen to his beautiful lecture. Put it on your iPod. Listen on the bus. Listen while you work.
Secondly, somebody recommended this documentary to me a short while ago: The Yes Men.</description>

      <description>Welcome to another instalment of Toponym of The Day. Today’s toponym is the longest place name in the world:
Llandfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrudrobwllllantysiliogogogoch
This is the name of a town in North Wales. It translates as “The church of St. Mary in the hollow of white hazel trees near the rapid whirlpool by St. Tysilio’s of the red cave” in Welsh (Source: Web of Linguistic Fun).</description>

Ironically I’ll be using the money I make to buy more overpriced textbooks for next semester in Print Futures (It’s going to be an awesome semester, I’m especially looking forward to the tech writing and document design courses).
Anyway, I’ve been hashing away at this 500 page book due next week and came up with some insights.</description>

      <description>This topic interests me because I lived for a year in South Korea in a little town close to the border. I went up to the border on more than one occasion and even have a piece of the barbed wire fence dividing North and South Korea. I&amp;rsquo;m waiting for re-unification. That piece of wire could be as momentous as having a piece of the Berlin wall. Anyway, if you have a minute to spare, check out this hilarious example of North Korean propaganda.</description>

      <description>…by using the power of social networking. Most of us living in today’s low-trust world have call display on our phones. Yet, what do you do if the number is unrecognized? If you’re like me, you just let unidentified numbers go through to your voicemail. But what if they don’t leave a message? Doesn’t the curiosity eat you up inside? What if it was your long lost uncle from Barbados? What if you finally won one of those quick getaway competitions you keep filling out entries for at your local grocery store?</description>

      <description>This phrase now resonates with new meaning after watching tonight’s performance of Verdi’s Macbeth at the Vancouver opera. There’s nothing like the tortured soul of Macbeth as he struts about the stage moaning in Italian and secretly wishing he’d never married Lady Macbeth. Seriously though, this was a solid opera, even although Carmen is still my favourite, it was my first time seeing an operatic adaptation of Shakespeare. I quite enjoyed it.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a wild weekend for us. Record snowfalls hit the western seaboard, burying the lower mainland under two feet of snow. It&amp;rsquo;s all anyone&amp;rsquo;s talking about, and rightly so, Vancouver usually gets a light dusting, if that. I attribute these strange weather patterns to climate change, but that&amp;rsquo;s probably because I also watched An Inconvenient Truth this weekend, which everybody must see. It just came out on DVD, so you have no excuses.</description>

      <description>We watched this video in our research course today. I managed to track down the original 1962 video and am posting it here because it is absolutely fascinating. Ever wonder wonder how much pain somebody will afflict on another merely because they were told to do so by an authority figure? Stanley Milgram, observed the Nuremberg Trials and wondered the same thing. How could so many Nazis, seemingly decent, ordinary people, justify the slaughter of others.</description>

      <description>I had some trouble with Awardspace and one of my PHP files. It was redirecting my discussion-options page to their homepage, but I’ve fixed that now thanks to the Wordpress forums. So what that means in practical terms is that you may now leave comments freely without registering your name or email address.
In addition to this, I realized the trackbacks are not working. This is an issue with Nik’s Little Vista theme and it will take some time to figure that one out.</description>

You can imagine the horror this letter inspired at this point in the semester. Anyway, sleepless nights aside, I called up the Student Loan centre today and I spoke to a robotic young lady called Angelina. She told me that I was in good standing and that I should call the CIBC student loan centre to see if the restriction originated from there.</description>

      <description>Here is a rivetting Channel 4 (BBC) documentary on the inventor of Tetris and the subsequent war between Nintendo and Atari over its console rights. This was so good I couldn’t tear myself away. This is not a documentary about a simple game, it’s a commentary on Russian bureaucracy and power plays between capitalism and communism.

Secondly, wasn&amp;rsquo;t that storm yesterday insane? It took out the power grid south of the Fraser and now the Vancouver Water Board has issued a warning not to drink the muddy discoloured water that bears a resemblance to weak tea.</description>

      <description>I’ve just finished a 20 page research project that scientifically tests the proverb “handsome is as handsome does”. I did this by administering a fictional survey to 3421 fictional women online. I showed the control group some profiles of accomplished men and asked them to rate the profiles. I then showed the experimental group the same profiles, this time with ugly headshots attached. The men’s ratings fell. Here is an example of the Likert scale I used:</description>

      <description>Today we watched a compelling drama based on the true story of Stephen Glass. This 25 year old rising star of New Republic magazine, the in flight mag of Air Force 1, was caught fabricating the vast majority of his pieces. He would go so far as to make up fake voice mails, notes and even a website to corroborate his lies. It’s a great movie called Shattered Glass. After watching the movie, our prof asked us to find Glass’s articles on Academic Search Premier.</description>

      <description>Welcome to wordspace. A place for my words to breathe. I’ve spent a fair bit of time building this website using PHP, MYSQL and the Wordpress engine. The template was designed by a webmaster called Nik. I got the ideas from Derek Miller - writer, editor and web guy. This is an organic project, and it’s just for fun really, but I plan on gradually making improvements to it as time permits.</description>

I reprint it here (edited for content) including my follow-up, without his kind permission, but I&amp;rsquo;m sure he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t mind.

This is something my S.A. friends might find interesting, although I hope you guys from &amp;ldquo;die moederland&amp;rdquo; will appreciate it was written for a North American audience. It was published in a magazine entitled &amp;ldquo;Think Equity&amp;rdquo; which is distributed on the U.B.C. campus; there is a PDF version available on-line, if you&amp;rsquo;re interested follow the link and check out page 4.</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen Brokeback Mountain yet but it seems even school administrators are &amp;ldquo;jumping on the bandwagon&amp;rdquo;, excuse the pun. I was wondering why one of my students was upset about some required reading for English class. That was before I saw the book:
I was so amused by it I searched around for alternative covers, but with little success:
This Cowboy looks like more of a stud, but his hand gesture suggests he is preparing to recite a monologue on the apparent emotional dangers of being a horse wrangler.</description>

Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m typing this right now on my Deepest Sender extension for Firefox, which is my new favourite browser! Internet Explorer has already become a distant memory.

      <description>I never buy lottery tickets. What a waste of money. Yet, I succumbed yesterday to all the hype surrounding Canada&amp;rsquo;s largest lotto jackpot at a staggering 54 million dollars. The odds were 1 in 14 million, which means I had a better chance of being killed on the freeway than winning, but when I thought about all that money, my feverish imagination started dreaming up private islands, planes and yachts as well as round the world vacations every month&amp;hellip;Apparently I wasn&amp;rsquo;t the only one as Canadians contributed over $90 million dollars to the lottery fund, almost half of which lines government pockets.</description>

      <description>The (illegal) strike by teachers in B.C. is causing a dangerous and detrimental societal rift. The government refuses to open up a dialogue with the B.C. Teachers Federation and resolve several key issues, including class sizes, support for special needs children and bargaining rights. The government has frozen the union&amp;rsquo;s assets. They have behaved like children. Yet it is the 600 000 children of this province who are being denied their education by the vulgar hubris of the government.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m still working, but don&amp;rsquo;t have any disposable income. What else is there to say? The summer has been good, I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a lot of hiking and swimming and enjoying the sunshine. Well, now I feel awkward, breaking my diary comments with inane comments. I&amp;rsquo;ll be going now, I hope everyone is doing splendiferously.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s Victoria day today, in Canada that is, and I&amp;rsquo;m not at all sure why it&amp;rsquo;s celebrated, I&amp;rsquo;m assuming it&amp;rsquo;s Queen Victoria&amp;rsquo;s birthday, but I could be wrong. Actually, I&amp;rsquo;m in a gloriously good mood, but alas, the poem I&amp;rsquo;m including today is quite incongruent with my current mellow vibe. I am running out of poems, you see. I certainly don&amp;rsquo;t have any happy ones left.

      <description>And here it is&amp;hellip;
The rainy poets What fell voices hath rent the darkened firmament,
Tearing asunder the veiled illusion that hides
The horror of infinity from our upturned eyes?
Indeed, it is a foul day with an evil bent
That we seek to smite with our sinful superstition
And ephemeral fairy-lights of our own deft construction
Yet here in the hiding holes, our futures are wrought
As we give sway to heavy dreams of lighter days</description>

      <description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t go anywhere really, but I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m at home in my mind, body and soul, so I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to start writing a poem once a week just for fun. These days I don&amp;rsquo;t have too much to say about my existence as a sunsangnim, I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve said it all before, and nobody reads this anymore because now I&amp;rsquo;m just an ordinary person lost in a plethora of other ordinary people&amp;rsquo;s narratives in cyberspace.</description>

      <description>Occasional journal writer that I am, it never fails to amaze me how insipid this whole thing is, or why I even bother at all. Yet, the idea of disbanding seems fatalistic somehow, like you&amp;rsquo;re leaving your public persona in the lurch or something. Anyhow, while I can hardly call this immersing oneself in the creative process, it is at least some form of writing&amp;hellip;these days a sporadic poem hastily scribbled at the back of my notebook is about the extent of my creative endeavours.</description>

      <description>You can&amp;rsquo;t fight city hall. Death and taxes. Don&amp;rsquo;t talk about politics or religion. This is all the equivalent of enemy propaganda rolling across the picket line. Lay down GI, lay down GI. We saw it all through the 20th century. And now in the 21st century, it&amp;rsquo;s time to stand up and realize that we should not allow ourselves to be crammed into this rat maze. We should not submit to dehumanization.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ll freely admit that life is tough right now, but isn&amp;rsquo;t it for everyone? I may as well share my angst. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to post that last entry, which I cut and pasted from another &amp;lsquo;secret&amp;rsquo; journal, but I thought it was fittingly angst-ridden that I may as well go public with it.</description>

      <description>That&amp;rsquo;s what we poets are. Fueled by magic and mayhem and the rich darkness that lurks in the deepest recesses of our souls, we seek the sources of our gloom and inspiration . There is a kind of poignancy and immediacy in our search, as if the infinite universe itself constantly clouds our vision with ubiquitous stars yet sears our dreams with the touch of God. We are les optimiste miserable, oxymorons of the dreamer, plagued with incompetence, completely ineffectual in the social worlds we inhabit, yet branded with the essence of life itself.</description>

I must say I was quite impressed with the teacher, who refrained from rapping on any of the boys heads with his blackboard marker. Thwock!

One of the first places we went was the natural hot springs, heated by the Volcano and just relaxed in successively hotter pools. Angela amazed our tour guide by jumping into the hottest pool at the top, over 65 degrees centigrade. On the lower levels they had a swim up bar and they didn´t mind taking wet money.</description>

We&amp;rsquo;re currently in Puerto Escondido, this awesome Surfing Mecca on the Oaxacan coast. A lot of gringos around, but otherwise great vibe and the biggest waves I´ve ever seen. Yesterday I wiped out on my boogie-board and I´m sure I cracked a rib after getting hurled beneath several monster waves. I guess I should tone down the risk-factor.</description>

      <description>Today I realized I actually am experiencing some sort of reverse culture shock. The thing is, with all the traveling I&amp;rsquo;ve done, I&amp;rsquo;m insensitive to the symptoms, sort of like when you get a cold. You&amp;rsquo;ve had a cold so many times before that most of the time you&amp;rsquo;re not cognizant of being ill until you hack up some flem or have to blow your nose.
After a few false starts, Jenny and I drove downtown and briefly checked out the beach; the wind was howling like a wounded banshee&amp;hellip;it was so beautiful&amp;hellip;walked down Robson and went shopping grimace&amp;hellip;It was awesome to check out the old haunts, but I definitely feel weird and disconnected, like a tourist.</description>

      <description>Hey, it&amp;rsquo;s the only Spanish I know, ok!!! I learned that from this Colombian girl I was going out with briefly before she decided to stop returning my calls. But that dear friends is another story. Suffice to say that I think speaking the same language is a &amp;lsquo;must&amp;rsquo; in any romantic relationship.
Today I sealed the deal at the travel agency. On the 22nd April Angela and I will be kicking it in the Caribbean!</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while. Obviously this entry marks a turning point of sorts, notably because I am no longer the Hermit in the Hermit Kingdom. This may not seem significant in itself, but the truth is, the hermit needed to write about his life in a foreign country, whereas I do not. I&amp;rsquo;m back in Canada and lost in limbo once more, trying to figure out how this life of mine should go.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m too busy to do much these days although I did manage to play a game of Scrabble in the bar with Sky last night. I had a strong start, but after a few beers, my lexical abilities correspondingly decreased to the point where I was laboriously spelling out the word &amp;ldquo;c-a-t&amp;rdquo; on the board for a measly five points.
The whole deal with Dean fell through, which means I not only have to tell him he&amp;rsquo;s not going to have a job when he gets here and that his original degree certificate is sitting here in a backwater Korean town, but I lose out on the $300 recruiting bonus.</description>

      <description>I have a feeling this journal will soon fade into obscurity and neglect, as often happens when people no longer feel the need to communicate their lives to others outside of their immediate social context. I hesitate to cease these writings entirely, but at the end of the month I will no longer be a hermit in the hermit kingdom, and this journal will have served it&amp;rsquo;s purpose. I am not one to constantly barrage an internet vacuum with the minutiae of my daily life but&amp;hellip; it is kind of cool having a blog I guess!</description>

      <description>Er, that&amp;rsquo;s happy Lunar new year, for those who are scratching their heads at my apparent lapse of chronological acuity. This means a cinq jours vacance pour moi, a much needed vacation, yes oh yes oh yes. The reason I haven&amp;rsquo;t written for a while is because I&amp;rsquo;d just be complaining about stuff and quite frankly I have better things to do. Things are going okay I guess, those boys in the morning class are really good and should actually be a couple of levels up, but somehow they got put in the lowest level, probably because they were really shy at first and were assessed incorrectly.</description>

      <description>Well, back into work full swing, and I have extra classes this month because of the special Winter program. The thing is that there&amp;rsquo;s only two boys in the program, which mean a staff allocation of three teachers for the two boys, adjusted schedules and me waking up an hour earlier every day&amp;hellip; just for two lads. At least they&amp;rsquo;re nice boys and they do their homework and everything, but still, it&amp;rsquo;s a little ridiculous.</description>

      <description>Well, today was one crazy day with the kids. Even though I begged and pleaded with just about everybody at work, and even outside of work, to play Santa, I was the one saddled with the duty of being &amp;lsquo;the evil one&amp;rsquo;. Yes, friends, I&amp;rsquo;ve been decidedly anti-Santa of late. Yesterday, I was so mad that nobody was respecting my sensitivities to the omniscient old man in red, especially our dear D, that I was quite curt and short-tempered with everybody.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve updated my website! Click here to check out my latest photographs! A little composition I&amp;rsquo;ve entitled &amp;ldquo;surreal&amp;rdquo;
I was horrified on Thursday night as I watched Sora pack up all her belongings and clear out her desk and tearfully announce to me that she was quitting and wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be coming in tomorrow. I don&amp;rsquo;t need to go into all the details and all the hypocrisy, but she was the primary scapegoat in this whole &amp;ldquo;bad pronunciation&amp;rdquo; witch-hunt.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m going absolutely mental, today was just one of those days. Nothing was sinking in and I was starting to zone out and lose all concentration and coherence of thought. We had a staff meeting in the morning where Debbie handed out our January schedules (a.k.a. 30 reasons not to get up in the morning), we have those &amp;lsquo;special classes&amp;rsquo; starting up again which means more hours, early mornings, less sleep and about three more years carved off my life expectancy.</description>

      <description>Not much to say really&amp;hellip; Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve become wary of being too friendly with strangers because so many people are just hungering for their very own foreign English teacher, whenever I hear the words &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m very interested in English!!!&amp;rdquo; I cringe inwardly because I know what&amp;rsquo;s coming next. The guy I met in the park wanted me to teach him English, the guy on the bus, the guy in my apartment building, even the lady who came to check for gas leaks in my gas furnace wanted me to teach her kids English.</description>

      <description>One amusing thing happened today which stuck with me. I popped out between classes to buy one of my favourite Korean snacks. It&amp;rsquo;s a kind of pastry shaped like a fish with black bean paste inside. I forget the name. Anyway, I asked the guy at the food stand how much it was and he relayed to me that it was 1000 won for four by holding up four fingers. Or was it three fingers?</description>

This is just a passing dark cloud, things in general are really quite good! Actually I&amp;rsquo;ve just been out in the chilly -4 degree centigrade night for a mini-photo shoot, it&amp;rsquo;s a full moon and the lighting is quite good.</description>

      <description>Well, today was my dreaded open class, without a doubt the most nerve-racking thing we&amp;rsquo;ve ever had to do at the school. I must say though, if they&amp;rsquo;d sprung it on me a few months back I would have crumpled under the pressure but these days I&amp;rsquo;m a real trooper. This time there was a full compliment of mothers eager to see their well-trained darlings perform for them. There were no major transgressions of our rules, nobody spoke Korean, nobody tried to steal my flashcards or use me as a human punching bag or set anything on fire.</description>

I had a good week-end, got lots of fresh air, ate some Indian food on Saturday night, rested up. I&amp;rsquo;m not looking forward to this week though. Anyways, better get some sleep, starting off the week in zombie-mode never bodes well for the rest of the week, although I think at this point it&amp;rsquo;s inevitable.</description>

      <description>Yesterday was a killer, but I&amp;rsquo;ve become quite good at putting up a stoic front and have almost completely given up complaining about anything or engaging in futile behaviour like swearing under my breath. One of our teachers found the open class on Thursday too stressful and apparently had a nervous breakdown and was hospitalized yesterday. Nobody seemed too sympathetic, probably because she has the least amount of work out of all of us and everybody was wondering why she is getting so stressed out over three students.</description>

      <description>I like that bit of poetic nonsense, ripped off from the Two Towers in case you didn&amp;rsquo;t pick it up. I guess that was my clumsy attempt at a reference since these days I&amp;rsquo;m adverse to any kind of plagiarism. I haven&amp;rsquo;t written for a while because I&amp;rsquo;ve been under a lot of stress lately. We&amp;rsquo;ve been preparing for these open classes, where the parents of our kindergarten students come and watch the class.</description>

      <description>Today was Pepero day. As far as I can make out it&amp;rsquo;s a kind of Korean Valentines&amp;rsquo; day where you&amp;rsquo;re obliged to give peperos to your girlfriend/boyfriend/good friend/anyone really. So what are peperos? Well, check it out - they&amp;rsquo;re long, thin chocolate straws. They look like number ones, in other words like 11&amp;frasl;11. Clever, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? But not as clever as the confectionary industry who no doubt spawned this little holiday!</description>

      <description>I think the full scope of one&amp;rsquo;s life can only be realized by those who have taken full responsibility for the enormity of it. So many in this world seem almost indignant that they are alive at all. Since they never asked to be alive in the first place they don&amp;rsquo;t feel it is necessary to explore their full potential as human beings, being merely content to get through life as safely and quickly as possible before it ends.</description>

      <description>Since I haven&amp;rsquo;t written for a while, I guess I&amp;rsquo;ll have to settle for an imagistic, yet succinct style and avoid expounding on some trivial event for the sake of play. For surely that is what all writing is, to &amp;ldquo;move or operate freely within a bounded space&amp;rdquo;, unlike the machine whose movements are sure and calculated, a writer&amp;rsquo;s words move like the water within a fountain, bounded by no immutable law except the limitations of the medium itself.</description>

      <description>Today was a field trip day, we took the kids on a train ride up north to Imjingak on the North-South border, the site of the &amp;lsquo;freedom bridge&amp;rsquo; which symbolically links the two countries. They built an amusement park, of all things, up there, so it&amp;rsquo;s a popular spot for school trips. We didn&amp;rsquo;t have to take the train, in fact the school bus dropped us off at the station and met us up at Imjingak, but the train trip was part of the fun for the kids.</description>

      <description>So yesterday I hooked up with my ex adult students and Sulu and went to some festivals around Paju. The first was a children&amp;rsquo;s book festival but they had art as well. We just strolled around drinking coffee and checking out the artwork. A major publishing house has just opened in Paju, which is an economic boon for the area. What I found most interesting was the blacksmith demonstrations. They were hammering shapes out of the metal.</description>

      <description>I was channel surfing the other morning during breakfast when I came across an episode of Oprah. She was talking about women in their late thirties and forties who were shocked to find out they couldn&amp;rsquo;t have children anymore. These women focused on their career, got rich and got married and bought six bedroom houses intending to fill them with kids only to find out their biological clocks had timed out and they were infertile.</description>

      <description>On Saturday I woke up late feeling refreshed after my forgetful Friday and decided to go sight-seeing. I set off with Tolstoy and Kimbap stowed safely in my backpack and the warm Autumn sun on my head. I felt like visiting some of the older, prehistorical archaeological sites I haven&amp;rsquo;t been to yet. My first destination was Amsa-Dong where I visited the excavation site of a Neolithic settlement. There were some interesting pit-house reconstructions and a decent display of arrowheads to see and the park-like setting was quite picturesque.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a long week-end because today is a public holiday, &amp;lsquo;foundation of Korea day&amp;rsquo; I believe. I&amp;rsquo;ve just slept for twelve hours trying to shake off a bad headache but unfortunately I woke up with it. Oh well, nuff said on inane health issues.
Yesterday was the annual &amp;ldquo;Speech Contest&amp;rdquo;, an event we&amp;rsquo;ve been preparing for weeks, jumping on the kids to learn their speeches. The winner gets a money voucher and a chance to compete at the school headquarters championships.</description>

      <description>Debbie told me last week that the director was thinking about booting me out of my adult class, which happens to be my favourite class, and replace me with Sulu. And I get S4 instead (ten/eleven year olds). She asked me if I wanted to do that, so I asked her if I actually had a choice in the matter, to which she replied, &amp;ldquo;Of course not&amp;rdquo;, which just about sums up the politics of being an employee in a Korean company.</description>

      <description>I think I&amp;rsquo;ve been day dreaming the whole week-end, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure where the time goes anymore. Friday night, went out to dinner with Sulu, had a few drinks in a mexican bar, shot some pool. Remembered why I never shoot pool. Went home. Been thinking alot, about art and pain, about people and our society, about the future. Just been for a night-time stroll, there was an orchestra playing a symphony in the parking lot of the city hall.</description>

      <description>Today wasn&amp;rsquo;t too bad at all. We went on a field trip to a farm/pottery workshop. The kids got to mould some clay plates which the workshop glazes for us and sends to the school. I made one too; my plate has a bas relief of a screaming face with dreadlocks. It was a corker of a day, the sun was blazing and it was so peaceful on the farm, this sounds flaky but there was a really good energy about the place.</description>

      <description>The title says it all, I&amp;rsquo;ve just gotten an ace haircut, and the best thing was I did it without any help! The dude actually spoke a smattering of English and cut up a storm. I was so pleased that I wanted to take him out for a beer afterwards (If I seem overly enthusiastic, then may I refer you to the entry of Wednesday, June 18th). There was the usual complement of attractive assistants standing to attention at my side.</description>

      <description>I feel so good right now, the sunshine has been blazing after the recent rains, I walk outside in bliss with my eyes half closed just soaking it in. It&amp;rsquo;s much cooler now too at the onset of fall, gone are those muggy, humid days. Yesterday I decided I needed a physical challenge so I took on the lesser of the three peaks of Bukhansan. So many people climb these mountains, I believe it&amp;rsquo;s the busiest national park in the world with over five million visitors a year.</description>

      <description>Woke up this morning to a rabid thunderstorm and relentless rain, stumbled outside half asleep to find the street had turned into a river, complete with refuse and unidentifiable small furry animals floating in it&amp;rsquo;s murky currents. If I&amp;rsquo;d bother to watch the news more often I would have seen that some typhoon by the Japanese islands is causing all this mayhem. Anyways, got to work muddy and furious and exhausted then had a really bad day&amp;hellip; The &amp;lsquo;Kittens&amp;rsquo; tore me apart, it was like that scene in Jurassic park where the fat traitorous guy falls in the mud and has hundreds of cute little dinosaurs swarming all over him eating him alive.</description>

      <description>Whenever I am abruptly awoken from my dreams, the level of exhaustion I feel henceforth seems far more intense than if I hadn&amp;rsquo;t been dreaming. My limbs feel like lead, a latent paralysis seems to dog my movements. I believe it has something to do with a certain chemical, a muscle inhibitor released during dream sleep to stop your body from physically acting out the dreams we perceive as reality. I don&amp;rsquo;t think this chemical fully dissipates from my body for several hours.</description>

      <description>A businessman’s car breaks down on his way to an important meeting. The only way to get there on time is to catch a minibus taxi, something he’s never done before. Hailing one down, he jumps into the only available seat, next to the driver.
As they drive along at breakneck speed, the traffic light in front of them turns red. Seeing this the driver accelerates and charges straight through the red light.</description>

      <description>Yesterday Sulu and I went to Everland, the seventh largest amusement park in the world. Unfortunately for us, yesterday was also the first day of Chuseok, which meant about 12 million Koreans were making the exodus south to their hometowns. In a fantastically unwise move, we took public transit&amp;hellip;so, we ended up standing in a crowded bus in a traffic jam for about four hours (it usually takes 40 minutes). I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen a traffic jam on a scale of this magnitude before, it was pure and utter torture.</description>

      <description>Today I woke up with an annoying ear ache so Debbie accompanied me to the doctor today, she also had to go because of a sore throat. It was my first time, but I had heard the anecdotes from the previous foreign teacher on Korean doctors so I kind of knew what to expect.
It was still jarring though. Let&amp;rsquo;s just say Korean doctors have mastered the arts of time management and impersonality.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve become an old man with evil powers who likes to wear flowing robes and cackle at other people&amp;rsquo;s misfortunes. So be it. At last now I know the true nature of the dark side.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a rainy week-end. Yesterday I went to Seoul, Itaewan and Yongsan to do some shopping.</description>

      <description>It might be the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s finally the week-end, but I seem to have regained my peace of mind. Hell, I&amp;rsquo;m even thinking about staying in Korea another year. If I did though, I would shoot for a university position. Nothing more prestigious than being an English prof &amp;lsquo;ey. I&amp;rsquo;m certainly not going to let a bunch of five year olds push me around. I&amp;rsquo;ve started integrating an aggressive point scoring system into the very fibre of the classroom experience.</description>

      <description>Warning: I had a bad day, this will not be a cheery entry. Turn back now.
Oh, how weary I feel. After a brief period of progress, my relationship with Kitten class has deteriorated once more. Anarchy rules and I suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. Debbie is horrified of course and I still cringe when I have to listen to her useless inapplicable advice. At this point I have resigned myself to the fact that I&amp;rsquo;m hopeless at teaching small foreign children under the age of ten.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m perpetually tired these days so it&amp;rsquo;s become the status quo. Sometimes I&amp;rsquo;ll wake up after a long sleep and feel strangely alive, realizing with a surprised recollection that this is what it feels like to be fully awake. It&amp;rsquo;s odd how one learns to adapt to altered physiological states. I have this long running argument with a friend who says that humans don&amp;rsquo;t need to sleep at all, we&amp;rsquo;ve only been socialized to.</description>

      <description>The rain has become unrelentless and I find myself being awoken by thunderstorms and accompanied by the constant drumming of monsoon rain throughout the day. I love this kind of rain, it cools everything down and cleanses the city. And rainy Sundays are awesome.
Last night I headed into Seoul to meet up with Nardus, his Korean friend Faye and a Canadian guy from Saskatoon called Art. Art kept making quips about the rain being like living in Vancouver and priding himself on wearing shorts in the -40 hellish Saskatchewan winters.</description>

      <description>Good evening one and all. First of all, I can see! Although I think I&amp;rsquo;ve merely become accustomed to sub-standard vision, that discomforting sensation of squinting through a fog has passed. I do tend to over-dramatize things, I know, but regardless I really was concerned. Tonight the other teachers were scuttling around in a working frenzy, and you should have seen the look of horror on their faces when I left &amp;lsquo;early&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>I think I&amp;rsquo;m going blind. Since I woke up this morning I&amp;rsquo;ve had blurry vision. I&amp;rsquo;m fairly squinting at the screen right now. I told Debbie if this continues I need to see a doctor because I&amp;rsquo;m quite alarmed. Actually I&amp;rsquo;ve had a bit of a rough day. This morning the kindergarten kids were eating me alive. They even went so far as to start tearing the pages of my storybook up.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve just gotten cable-internet hooked up in my apartment and I must say it&amp;rsquo;s very very sweet!

      <description>Narrating the copious and boring details of my life is starting to feel tedious to me. This attitude, unfortunately, poisons the writer’s work, seeping into the pores of every sentence. Writing into a near vacuum seems somewhat pointless to me now, especially considering I’m a very private person and will never indulge in unbridled catharsis in this journal. Of course the inner workings of any human mind makes for a more fascinating read than a day to day laundry list of events, but I cannot do that here, and hence, I’m frustrated by my self-imposed restrictions.</description>

      <description>Yep, war metaphors are always appropriate in &amp;lsquo;teacher discourse&amp;rsquo;. Well, being back at work isn&amp;rsquo;t that bad. I&amp;rsquo;m beginning to find that a little caffeine continuously flowing through ones veins allows one to keep up with even the most frenetic kids. Of course I officially have no life, so being a slave to one&amp;rsquo;s current occupation doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem a great sacrifice at this point. Well, let no-one accuse me of being a pessimist, that&amp;rsquo;s what I say.</description>

      <description>Yes, yes, I haven&amp;rsquo;t been motivated to do much in this heat, and work starts up again tomorrow, oh joy of all joys. Brian had downloaded some movies from the net, so we watched those last night, they haven&amp;rsquo;t come out in Korea yet which is kind of cool. Johnny English was hilarious. I don&amp;rsquo;t, however, recommend Tomb Raider 2, unless you have insomnia or some perverse desire to see Angelina Jolie pretending to be cool.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m becoming increasingly aware of potential health hazards in my environment, including the water, which I believe is quite toxic no matter how many times you boil and filter it. Thank goodness I am still young and somewhat hardy, although I have been feeling a bit fragile of late.</description>

      <description>Shudder. I just witnessed a guy on his scooter getting whacked by a car. I was just looking right at him when it happened too, thinking how dangerous it is to ride around on scooters without helmets. Everybody whips around on their scooters without protection, it&amp;rsquo;s a death wish, especially considering how c-r-a-z-y Korean drivers are. The insane traffic took a while to get used to, when I first got here I stood waiting at a Zebra crossing for five minutes until Sean explained to me that cars never stop at crossings.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ll make sure this entry is peppered with links for those who wish to learn more and expand their knowledge-bases. Let&amp;rsquo;s see&amp;hellip;Two Sundays ago I went to the Sodaemun Prison Hall. This was a Japanese prison camp for political prisoners and activists during their occupation of Korea. All the original buildings remain, including the execution chamber and various torture devices, which you can try out if you are so inclined.</description>

The internet server at work has been unplugged or is down or something so that lengthy update I promised my audience (of perhaps one or two people, sorry guys) will have to wait.

      <description>Last night we went drinking at &amp;ldquo;The Posse&amp;rdquo;. I last went there a few months ago with the cowboy Sean. There are lots of surreal kinds of &amp;lsquo;American&amp;rsquo; bars in this town I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed. Pirates and Indians seem to be huge cultural icons (stereotypes) and a must when planning the interior decorating. The bartender/owner Storm still works there, he&amp;rsquo;s pretty cool, mostly because he understands what drinks you&amp;rsquo;re ordering. We also went to &amp;ldquo;The Sunset&amp;rdquo;, which has been renamed &amp;ldquo;rpm 8000&amp;rdquo; and doesn&amp;rsquo;t have live music anymore, just a lot of fairy lights and an odd smell.</description>

      <description>Today we took the kids on a field trip to Honey Land, so that they could have a swim in the pool. It was a stinking hot summer day, so the timing was perfect. I was worried about the safety of the kids but the kid&amp;rsquo;s pool was so shallow and they all had inflatable tubes, so there was nothing to worry about. The youngest kids (3 and 4 yr olds) were funny, they just kind of bobbed there not moving with their swimming caps and goggles on, like weird human water buoys.</description>

      <description>This week doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to have made much of an impression on me, so I suppose it was a fairly benevolent one, if you can characterize the passing of time as benevolent, that is. Yet I may also suppose that one&amp;rsquo;s daily trivia adds up to a life, and this is my life, as banal as it may be. So, let&amp;rsquo;s see what happened&amp;hellip;
This week I composed a disco dance version of &amp;ldquo;Itsy Bitsy Spider&amp;rdquo; which the kids really love.</description>

      <description>You may or may not recall that the school I work for published a little thing about teaching that I wrote, well they botched it up somewhat on the internet version, it got cut off, but it&amp;rsquo;s cool to see so many South Africans teaching in Korea. That guy Nardus - he&amp;rsquo;s South African who lives in New Zealand - I met him when I went to Japan, he has a degree in Anthropology and is a good guy.</description>

      <description>Well, well. Another week had rolled by in a heartbeat. Hardly time to take stock of things. Not a bad week, besides from communicative difficulties with a certain un-named co-worker, who insists on voicing her grievances about me to everyone but me. I think she may be slightly xenophobic. Also, Won Jang Nim was going to film my Smile 1 class this week, but firstly her batteries ran out, then secondly she had an appointment, and so on, so the frame by frame videotape analysis of my teaching competence will have to wait.</description>

      <description>Last week was pretty tough going, in addition to inane phone teaching there was a field trip and a story contest. The field trip was an outing to the movies where we watched &amp;lsquo;Finding Nemo&amp;rsquo; (dubbed into Korean of course). Aaah Disney, what more can I say. The cinema was at the top of a giant mall. We actually managed to squeeze all thirty or so kids into one elevator, much to the indignation of several elderly shoppers who braced themselves against the elevator walls in terror.</description>

      <description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t end up going to the K63 building yesterday because Sora sprained her ankle, poor girl, she&amp;rsquo;s so frail. It&amp;rsquo;s funny, she learns a lot of her English phrases from &amp;ldquo;The Truman Show&amp;rdquo;, her favourite movie. She was horrified when I had a good laugh and told her Jim Carey&amp;rsquo;s English was hardly standard. Especially phrases like &amp;ldquo;Alrighty then, that&amp;rsquo;s the whole kit and caboodle!&amp;rdquo; But then I got to thinking, what is standard English?</description>

      <description>&amp;hellip;for this is no spicy narrative&amp;hellip;I&amp;rsquo;m sitting here in air-conditioned bliss&amp;hellip;it&amp;rsquo;s swelteringly hot outside, and the sticky monsoon season is upon us. It&amp;rsquo;s market day in Kumchon and the local vendors have taken over the crooked streets and spread their wares out under colourful beach umbrellas. The smell of raw fish and Kimchi wafts through the streets.
Not much happened this week, but it&amp;rsquo;s that busy time of the month, when I have to write report cards for my forty-odd students and compile monthly lesson plans.</description>

      <description>Just a quick update&amp;hellip; Nothing extraordinary has happened recently, but I did get a haircut, which is always an adventure. This time I asked Sora to come with me and translate because last time I just looked up &amp;lsquo;short&amp;rsquo; in the dictionary and hoped they would get the idea. It didn&amp;rsquo;t turn out too well. This time wasn&amp;rsquo;t much better, mostly because most Korean men get the same haircut (the infamous &amp;lsquo;line&amp;rsquo;), and it&amp;rsquo;s hard trying to communicate the concept of &amp;lsquo;tapering&amp;rsquo;, even with a translator.</description>

      <description>I know the title doesn&amp;rsquo;t make much sense, but I saw it painted on a garage door somewhere in Point Grey, and thought it was kind of cool. I&amp;rsquo;ve just received an e-mail from Dean, the anthropologist I met at Mount Namsan - he&amp;rsquo;s back in Melbourne! I guess all his plans to wander through India like a traveling ascetic was just all talk.
On Thursday night we went out to dinner at one of my student&amp;rsquo;s parent&amp;rsquo;s restaurants (Arnold).</description>

      <description>Greetings loyal readers, and thanks for joining me once again, here in South Korea, at once so bizarre yet so familiar. Let&amp;rsquo;s see, an update of my long week-end is in order. Friday was memorial day, a day to remember those brave Korean soldiers who died during Japanese occupation and in the Korean war. A few of us teachers hired the school bus driver to drive us in the school bus to an island - Mwi-do (do=island) off the West coast.</description>

      <description>Well, I just don&amp;rsquo;t know where my days go, with my mind as dazed as it is, and being as overworked as I am, I&amp;rsquo;m surprised anything at all is being written here. I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m immersed in an infinite stream of &amp;lsquo;teacher-consciousness&amp;rsquo;, where my thoughts are overwhelmingly occupied with the progress of the kids, individual cases, tests, flashcards, storybooks where &amp;ldquo;A green monster lives in a green house&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Mr.</description>

      <description>Although I have no illusions about this journal being widely read by anyone, it&amp;rsquo;s purpose is to supplant lengthy expository e-mails while I&amp;rsquo;m in South Korea. What you&amp;rsquo;ll find here will be factual accounts of my days, or at best incoherent ramblings representing the remnants of some vague, out-of-context thought that may have splurged accidently onto the screen. I make no promises as to consistency or regularity or for that matter rigorous censorship.</description>
